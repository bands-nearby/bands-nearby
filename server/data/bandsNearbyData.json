Beginning as a solo endeavor, it now regularly features other musicians in concert and as guests on records.  Original inspiration for the band came from wanting to merge the styles of fingerpicked acoustic guitar with more improvisational drone elements. A copy of Hans Peter Duerr’s Dreamtime book provided the early blueprint for the analogy of fingerpicked acoustic guitar as civilization vs.",

  "artistSummary": "To hear Sarah Versprille and Daniel Hindman tell it, their Portland, OR-based band Pure Bathing Culture has always evolved naturally and at a steady pace. \"That's really the path we've been on as a band, always putting one foot in front of the other as opportunities presented themselves,\" Versprille said. \"The music just revealed itself to us as we kept going.\" \nBut for Pure Bathing Culture's second album, Pray for Rain, the band has taken a big leap forward. You can hear it from the opening notes of their anthemic title track: in Hindman's clean yet serpentine guitar lines interacting with the live rhythm section and Versprille's lucid vocals cutting through it all as she asks: \"Is it pleasure? Is it pain? Did you pray for rain?\" Pray for Rain is the sound of the group confidently taking a step up to the next level and finding their footing as a true band. \n\"We needed to make a big step and our version of that was to cut the cord from our previous albums,\" Hindman said of the process, then confesses: \"I was nervous all the way through. It was nerve-wracking and almost antagonizing at times.\" \nThe roots of Pure Bathing Culture stretch back to 1999, when Versprille and Hindman befriended one another on the first day of freshman orientation at William Patterson University in Wayne, New Jersey. A decade later, they became bandmates when they both joined Vetiver for their Sub-Pop albums Tight Knit and The Errant Charm. It was while playing in Vetiver that Pure Bathing Culture emerged as its own entity. \n\"Dan was working on some instrumentals that he would make on a looping pedal,\" Sarah said. \"One night he was out and I just listened to this loop and wrote some lyrics to it. He came home and I showed it to him. We laughed at first, as we didn't have some grand plan to start a band. It just happened naturally.\" That song \"Lucky One,\" wound up in the hands of Richard Swift, who encouraged the duo to keep writing. \"Richard pushed us along and became an inspiration,\" Dan said. Swift wound up producing the band's first EP and dreamy full-length, 2013's Moon Tides at his National Freedom studio. \nFrom there, PBC evolved from simply being the product of Versprille and Hindman writing songs in their own home to hitting the road as a full touring band. \"Sarah and I conceptualize music and then write so it's a pretty fragile state,\" Hindman said. \"Playing live was a huge change for us.\" \nWhen it came time to write and record their follow-up to Moon Tides, the duo knew what they didn't want. \"We didn't gravitate towards someone making indie dream-pop records,\" Dan said. That was when producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, Swans, Angel Olsen, The Walkmen) reached out to the band and invited them to come record with him in his Dallas, TX studio. \n\"John pushed us to not make clichés, to not play into the style of other bands,\" Dan said. The challenges came right away as Congleton pressed the group into unfamiliar and at times uncomfortable territory in the studio. \"He tricked me with the guitars on the album,\" Dan said. \"We got the basic tracks down and he asked me to do scratch guitar and then John wouldn't let me go back and do the guitars again. He refused to do any layering.\" \nAs a result, everything on Pray for Rain is pretty much as Pure Bathing Culture actually sounds, all analog gear, with virtually no plug-ins or effects added afterwards, no hiding behind multiple layers. \"There aren't a lot of tricks; What you hear is naturally what's there,\" Dan said. \nIt was a taxing yet ultimately rewarding experience when the album was completed. \"It was shocking to hear what the finished product was,\" Sarah said. \"It was like being in a vortex and then we came out with this record.\" She adds with a laugh something John Congleton told her when all was said and done: \"You were very brave.\" \nSarah summarizes the Pray for Rain experience as one of \"stepping into the realm of discovering who we are as a band and as songwriters,\" echoing a theme of the album itself, the process of change and transition. \"You can find the best version of yourself in those hardest moments,\" she said. To which Dan adds: \"You have to be backed up against the wall in order to really feel those feelings and respond to them.\" Pray for Rain is the sound of Pure Bathing Culture transforming from who they were to who they will be, of finding their way, ready to take steps both small and momentous on their musical path.",

Tender Warriors Club is not just a collection of songs. It is meant to serve as an emblematic space for people to relate in the shared interest of emotional vulnerability, using music as the collective form of self-expression. It is my hope that this work and concept can be a reminder to both myself and others to find the courage to remain sensitive through emotional challenges. I'd like to bring these themes into intimate spaces musically, without amplification or a traditional stage, as a means to connect through the aforementioned concept that striving to express oneself with tenderness is ultimately a strength.\"both fear and love: internally and externally, before and after.",

  "artistSummary": "(of The Get Down Stay Down)\nThao (of the Get Down Stay Down) is a San Francisco based band fronted by singer and songwriter Thao Nguyen-She released her fourth album, A Man Alive, on March 4, 2016. Following the critical success of We The Common (2013), which was largely inspired by Thao's volunteer work with the California Coalition for Women's Prisoners, A Man Alive is an evolution in both subject matter and sound. Thao says: \"I wanted A Man Alive to be beat- and bass-driven-rather than guitar-based-extending and elaborating upon the hip-hop influences of the previous record. A Man Alive is more instrumental, more riff- and loop-centric, and has more manipulated sounds.\" The Get Down Stay Down are at their best on this record, and Thao herself experimented with programming drumbeats for several tracks, although live drums are also played on every song. \nMostly recorded at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco, A Man Alive was produced by Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards. Collaborating with Garbus, who is a close personal friend, allowed Thao to achieve the sound she had been striving for on previous releases. \"Looking back,\" she says, \"I was less sure of what I wanted. With this record I had clearer vision and aspirations. I wanted emotion. I wanted power. I wanted beats. Merrill's priority was that I take songs and ideas and run with them; she pushed us all over the place. She carved out time and space for us to experiment at will and fostered a very supportive, creative environment. Everyone was compelled to go beyond what they were comfortable doing. Musician-wise we kept it tight knit because the songs were so personal and vulnerable, and it was such an intense process, I only wanted those who know me well.\" \nA Man Alive finds Thao exploring darker and more personal territory than in her earlier songwriting. She grew up in Northern Virginia, on the outskirts of Washington, DC. When Thao was young, her father left the family. She helped out in her mother's laundromat as a teenager, sitting at the counter with a guitar, making change for customers, working on her first songs, and playing at open mics in the evenings. Her father drifted in and out of their lives. \n\"The record is essentially about my relationship with my dad, its trajectory. It's a document of my life in conjunction with his, even though we've always been leading our lives away from each other. Some are optimistic and forgiving, some are the opposite. There are songs from his perspective: I imagined what it would be like to have kids and choose to exist without them, or feel like you have to save them from yourself. I realized there was this relationship that I never really talk about, realized it's defined so much of me. So it was a point of reckoning. The record wrote itself. Painstakingly, of course.\"\n\nThe emotional center of A Man Alive is the gorgeous, plaintive \"Millionaire,\" a song about a wayward father. While the song could have ended up as a folk ballad, its instrumentation and atmosphere is of a piece with the rest of the album, pushed along by heavily reverbed synthesizer, a simple guitar riff, and subdued drums and bass. \"That's a sad fucking song,\" Thao said. \"I remember walking out of the vocal booth, and I saw Merrill tearing up. It's uncompromisingly sad, which I don't traffic well in. It took a lot.\" \nMuch of A Man Alive is vibrant and danceable-including standout tracks such as \"Astonished Man,\" \"Slash/Burn,\" \"Nobody Dies,\" and \"Meticulous Bird\"-and the juxtaposition of that exuberance with the dark themes explored in the lyrics is one of the album's great achievements. The songs are often punctuated by handclaps, sing-along choruses, and ass-shaking beats. While these songs come from a deeply personal origin, they have such an accessible quality that it is easy to imagine an engaged and participatory live audience. \"I suspect that's always been my motive,\" Thao says, \"but this is the most actualized that it's ever been. I wanted to make a record that was very introspective and personal, but it would also seek to communicate. And we would have fun performing it-not just fun, but I wanted a kind of crazy, rabid, animal energy. That's my favorite thing about performing-you can tap into this frenzy. We want people to dance and feel. And I want to do that every night, too.\" \nA Man Alive is undoubtedly a new career highlight for Thao & The Get Down Stay Down. The album presents a fiercely original group sound that is rife with experimentation and playfulness. It demonstrates Thao's development as a songwriter. And it achieves that most elusive quality in music-to create an album of songs that are dark yet buoyant, tragic yet redemptive, personal yet inclusive.\n\n-Dan Stone",

  "artistSummary": ": The Complete U2 Experience\nThe lights go down, it's dark and the soaring sound of a rock band bound for greatness collides with the low ceiling of a small club. It's like 1978 all over again, when U2 first stormed the pubs of Dublin, Ireland. \nBut this is the 21st Century in San Francisco, and the band is Zoo Station, a quartet that bills itself \"The Complete U2 Experience.\" Since 2001, this talented force has delivered the visual, musical and spiritual thrill of a U2 concert to bars, clubs, outdoor festivals, private parties and corporate events along the West Coast of North America. Singer Bonalmost leads the show, flying high with the vocal strength and confidence of Bono's The Joshua Tree days. The Sledge showers thick layers of effectual guitar work over crowd as Adamesque on bass and Barely Larry on the drums deliver the pounding heartbeat of some of modern rock's most memorable songs. \nThe band's primary job is replication, but periodically Zoo Station innovates as much as it imitates. During their trademark full-album spotlight sets in which the band plays an entire U2 album from start to finish Zoo Station encounters such obscurities as \"Elvis Presley and America,\" \"Promenade,\" \"Red Hill Mining Town\" and \"Acrobat,\" songs rarely or never performed live by U2. \n\"Songs like these are exciting,\" says Bonalmost. \"All we can really do is ask ourselves, 'What would U2 have done onstage?'\" \nMore familiar are melodies like \"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Beautiful Day,\" and \"Vertigo.\" Behind the band, a multi-media visual projection system elevates Zoo Station's performances to the highest level of virtual authenticity. Swirling abstract imagery appears behind the stage, interspersed with rapid-fire \"U2-phemisms\" and in-synch flashing light choreography. All are recognizable from U2 shows, and these visual effects, centerpieced by Bonalmost's lively theatrics, reflect Zoo Station's deep-set love of U2′s music and their commitment to fully recreating the dense emotional impact of a U2 concert. \nSince day-one, when an earnest Craigslist posting sparked the band, Zoo Station has played over 450 shows and now flourishes a repertoire of more than 150 U2 songs. The sing-along radio hits appease casual listeners, while the most loyal U2 fans are wowed by the surprising depth and variety of the set list. Such thrilling rock and roll was made for vast arenas, one-acre stages and sky-high screens, and though U2 quit the bar scene in 1980, Zoo Station thrives there, doing what U2 no longer can: setting the smallest neighborhood pubs burning to life with a sound that has drowned out the world.",

  "artistSummary": "From the beginning,  have been a classic band's band, and a true collaboration: three longtime friends, three songwriters, two singers in a true dual frontman setup, all individuals but all woven more and more tightly together as they have evolved. In a world that rewards drama, reckless moves and often-overwrought narrative twists, The Dig have bucked that trend by focusing on, well, the work: writing song after song to cast off more than they keep, and keep only the best. The Dig do a lot, and they do it the right way — building brick by brick, writing constantly, touring steadily, and most crucially, pushing themselves creatively to make better and better records. Which brings us, of course, to Bloodshot Tokyo, a record rich with ambition and a bright, irresistible ease.\"In the past I think we've tried to create a mindset of writing 'for The Dig'\", says guitarist/keyboard playing Erick Eiser, \"so as to create something cohesive. This time I think we really freed ourselves from that, and just wrote.\" They made the most of their interconnectedness as a way to push themselves forward, writing what singer and bassist Emile Mosseri describes as \"elaborate demos\" for most of the songs. Arrangements were fully worked out, ideas were explored and re-explored before they sat down to record. Emile continues, \"It's not hard to write songs separately, but there's a thing that happens where I'll sometimes have the other guys in my head, even when I'm writing by myself. So in a way, we're kind of always writing together even when we're writing alone. We all grew up playing in different bands together since we were little kids, and have toured with and were inspired by all kinds of different bands for years. I feel like writing this record was the sum of all those years. It's the most wide spanning stylistically and colorful of our records, and also sounds the most like us.\"The result is a tremendously confident record, and one that's far punchier than its predecessors. Even with veritable piles of songs to choose from, it feels oddly apt that Bloodshot Tokyo opens with the brief snippet that is \"Ordinary Mind\". It is a sparkling, hugely inviting riff and a refrain that paves the way, just a small fragment too good to let go of. \"Jet Black Hair\" follows and is an undeniable A-sider, putting the band's pop instincts front and center, never shying away from the groove but never weighed down by it, either. Lead single \"Simple Love\" moves stealthily, winking to just a little something retro but dancing across genres in an exhilaratingly modern way. As a band, The Dig made a choice to turn somewhat from the more ambient sounds of their earlier songs, using those tones as texture to drive songs with other foundations, rather than making it the focal point. Drummer Mark Demiglio, The Dig's relative newcomer, brings a modern pop counterweight to The Dig's moodier side, and it shows. Songs like \"Pool of Rotting Water\" underline that change, going downright beat-driven with just the right amount of glam for a band that is, at its heart, very much a rock band. And what of the records return to love as a theme? Singer and guitarist David Baldwin explains, \"there are elements of both a falling in love and a break up album for sure. I think the songs we picked all generally came from so many different phases and mindsets, there might be different stages in a relationship juxtaposed into the same song. Certain songs may come off like breakup songs but were written while in the peak of a relationship. A kind of regret from the future that hasn't happened yet.\"No band escapes talking about its influences, but its particularly telling that The Dig's members often come back to The Kinks, Harry Nilsson, Betty Harris, Parliament, even Bach — artists who worked in the canon of their eras' pop music, but always with an eye toward upending pop's expectations, fraying the edges, getting weird. Baroque structures and subtle nods pop up throughout , in the low end of \"Bleeding Heart\" or the keyboard swirl of \"Simple Love\", and they permeate the art surrounding this new collection, as well.Everywhere you look these days, there are \"I could do that\"-type cynics. But could they, really? And if they did, could they keep the same wide-eyed spirit The Dig has had for years, since the band's two singers formed their first band as kids? The songs that make up this long-player have a magic borne from that dedication, where tremendous work and discipline meet a lifetime of collaboration and a joyful, insatiable love for songwriting. As it relates to one band's rock record, it may seem strange to point out how cynical the world happens to be right now, but it takes dedication and a deep well of talent to do it like The Dig do it, and do it so well.",

  "artistSummary": "Andy Shauf is a storyteller, a singer of heartbreak and regrets, isolation and loneliness, reflecting his prairie surroundings in Regina, Canada. Meticulously written over four years, Shauf’s The Bearer of Bad News is a warm and welcoming album, bathed in weathered piano, dampened drums, softly-strummed guitars and clarinet, which lends its unique timbre to frequently brighten – or hauntingly underscore – the songs’ darker undercurrents. Fans of Elliott Smith, Nick Drake and Harry Nilsson, take note. \nAldous Harding\nAldous Harding’s music is not for the faint of heart. Disarming in its desolate imagery and stark instrumentation, it deals with the raw materials of life: death, birth, grief and love. There are few happy endings, but the power is in how Harding enters into battle; with a dancer’s grace and a boxer’s stance.\n\nSometimes reminiscent of 60s-era folk singers Vashti Bunyan and Linda Perhacs, Harding’s work lies in more harsh terrain than her forebears – piercing the long history of the genre with a grit and sincerity rarely encountered. Somewhat out of step with the 21st Century, Aldous’ music is accompanied by wry wit and tenacious gall that will see her become a true stayer in the music world. \nHailing from New Zealand’s Southern port town of Lyttelton, Aldous has received attention and accolades from some of the most illustrious corners of the music industry. Her self-titled debut album received 4 stars in MOJO and Uncut, while UK blog The 405 hailed her a “toweringly talented song writer”. \nWhile the album was released nearly a year ago in New Zealand, it continues to thrive after releases in Australia and Europe, Aldous’ music timelessly out of step with fleeting trends. Following the Australian release, she played Sydney & Perth Festivals and Golden Plains. She has also toured with Tiny Ruins, Perfume Genius and Laura Jean.",

  "artistSummary": "The Sam Chase has a voice like a Nun on the lam with a mouthful cigarettes and curse words in a lonely bar, drunkenly dancing next to a broken jukebox. His songs are scribbled, not written, on lipstick and sweat stained motel bedsheets because he likes the way the ink bleeds. His guitar runs on diesel and leaks like the morning after too much Whiskey. His is a show you'll probably want to tattoo on your body so everyone will know that you knew him before he was cool.\n\nHailing from the hills of San Francisco, California, Sam and his band whom he lovingly refers to as The Untraditional, take to stages all over the country with a virulent and frenetic passion which many history buffs might liken to the Norse warriors known as The Berserkers, who were known to have fought their battles with an uncontrollable, trance-like fury. Norse literature notes that they would work themselves into a rage before battle, consuming drugged foods, and dressed in nothing but their enemies blood. The Sam Chase and The Untraditional do maintain that spirit, but leave the drugged foods and enemies blood up to the discretion of the crowd. \n\nIn 2012, came the release of his long awaited first studio album, THE SAM CHASE WILL LEAD US TO VICTORY. It took the group all across these United States and back to their home in the Bay Area. The cry came for more, so the band dove head first into writing and preparing a new album. In late May of 2013 THE SAM CHASE WILL NEVER DIE was released. Many children have been conceived to this album since it's release and all of the children who are now born are showing higher than normal levels of intelligence and immunity to most diseases. \n\nAs of the early hours of 2016, Sam and the band have gone back into the studio and laid down 13 brand new tracks. The new album is slated to drop on April 29th, 2016. Many sages and religious fanatics believe that it will bring about the end of days. Stay safe. These are troubled and unpredictable times. \nM. Lockwood Porter\nM. Lockwood Porter’s songs toe the line between country-tinged Americana and straight-up rock-and-roll, with poetic storytelling front and center. A SF Bay Area transplant from rural Oklahoma, Porter’s sound recalls his birthplace and a childhood spent exploring the far reaches of the rock canon. The result is something close to timeless - reminiscent at times of Neil Young, Wilco, Ryan Adams, and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nPorter first caught the attention of many fans and critics with the release of his home-recorded debut LP Judah’s Gone in July 2013. At the time, Independent Clauses called him “a talent to watch”, and The Bay Bridged wrote that he was “poised to join… the national Americana scene with the release of his debut LP, Judah’s Gone.” In October 2014, Porter followed up his promising debut with 27, the bold, carefully crafted work of a talented young artist.\n\nOn 27, we find Porter (who himself turned 27 just before the al) wrestling with a growing awareness of life’s limited possibilities with a mixture of melancholy and defiance similar to that of Carter-era Springsteen, describing failing relationships with a nuanced poignancy reminiscent of Ryan Adams and Lucinda Williams, and eulogizing Big Star founder Chris Bell - who died at age 27 (like Kurt and Jimi, as Porter reminds us) – while name-checking Paul Westerberg and arguing with Neil Young on “Chris Bell”. \n\nIn other words, 27 is a confident-sounding record. That’s a bit ironic for an album that - half breakup record, half quarter-life crisis – is all about the disillusionment and sense of “Is this really all there is?” characteristic of one’s late twenties. But Porter’s willingness to write and sing about the travails and uncertainties of life with courage and honesty is exactly what makes 27 such a compelling album.\n\n27 was primarily recorded in San Francisco’s Hyde Street Studio C - where classic albums like CCR’s Cosmo’s Factory, Grateful Dead’s American Beauty, and CSNY’s Deja Vu were recorded. Showcased on these songs is Porter’s new live band. The band is both tight and spontaneous – sounding something like a cross between Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers, The Band, and Wilco – bringing a rawness and intimacy to the performances that a home recording never could. Porter’s vocals, too, are stronger and more confident – honed by a year of gigging in support of Judah’s Gone. \nThe Dixie Giants\nThe Dixie Giants are a Traditional Jazz group based out of Sonoma County, California. We are comprised of music educators, jazz students, and a wine maker in training.",

  "artistSummary": "Dead Meadow formed in 1998 with Jason Simon on vocals and guitar, Steve Kille on bass, and Mark Laughlin on drums. They began to combine 70s hard rock and 60s psychedelic rock with far out and sometimes mystically minded lyrical themes occasionally even hinting at the obscure genius H. P. Lovecraft and other far out writers of the bizarre and weird.[1] The first album, Dead Meadow, was released in 2000 on Tolotta Records, a label run by Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. The LP version was released by Planaria Records. This was quickly followed by 2001's Howls from the Hills, also released on Tolotta Records. At the completion of \"Howls from the Hills\" John Peel asked Dead Meadow to record a Peel Session which was recorded in Fugazi's home studio, the first time a Peel Session was recorded outside the BBC studios.[1]\n\nn Spring 2002, Laughlin parted ways with the band in order to pursue a career as a lawyer. He was replaced by long-time friend Stephen McCarty ). A live album, Got Live If You Want It, was released in mid-2002, which documented one of the last shows with drummer Mark and was produced by Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre. In early 2003 the band signed with Matador Records and released Shivering King and Others. Along with the heavy song and blues-influenced songs as on the previous two records, the band continued in their psychedelic style, with acoustic elements and ballads. With the addition of second guitarist Cory Shane, Feathers was released in 2005. Simon’s guitar virtuosity is influenced by the droning modal character of Eastern music as by classic rock riffs.\n\nJason Simon is the nephew of The Wire creator David Simon. Dead Meadow's music was used briefly in the episode React Quotes in season five of The Wire.\n\nIn 2007 the band has reverted back to a three piece, made an appearance at the 5th annual Green Man Festival in Crickhowell, Wales and relocated from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn the beginning of 2008, Dead Meadow released Old Growth on Matador Records. A collection of songs that brought the band back initially to the same farm that their second release Howls from the Hills was created and eventually finished up at the legendary Sunset Sound studio in Los Angeles. As with the last three albums Old Growth was produced by bassist Steve Kille.\n\nLater in that same year a brief session with Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother led to the reinterpretation of the Dead Meadow song \"Everything's Goin' On\" as a new song \"Pilgrim\" landing on the second release for Wolfmother, \"Cosmic Egg\".\n\nIn March 2010 the band released a feature length live film and soundtrack, \"Three Kings\", that spotlights their stage show along with psychedelic dream scenarios. The live footage and audio was captured at the bombastic final show of the five month \"Old Growth\" tour. The film premiered at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California[2] and was released on the NYC label Xemu Records, co-run by Kille.\n\nJason Simon also announced his September release of his first solo \"self-titled\" acoustic album on TeePee Records.\n\nThe song \"Sleepy Silver Door\" and \"Greensky Greenlake\" were featured in the skate video \"Emerica, Stay Gold.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Between the vast expanses and disparate extremes of space lies “The High Frontier:” a term coined by Gerard K O’Neil in his illustrated 1976 book depicting human colonization of space. In their new thusly titled LP, Lumerians send terrified primates into space in search of wonders both marvelous and harrowing. In a starship powered by gamma-ray-mutated rock, beer-goggled cartographers chart the absurd scales of outer space from subatomic to trans-galactic and the unfathomable void of inner space unbound by physical laws. Inward perception, both fluid and delicate, births, destroys, multiplies and collides temporal realities. Hacking through gnarled carnivorous plants with pyrokinetic machetes, Lumerians thrust forward with Krautrock inspired exploration, Afrobeat’s ritualistic rhythms, post-punk guitar noise and cracked-glacé synth lines culled from perverse 1970’s sci-fi soundtracks. As a followup to 2011’s “Transmalinnia,” “The High Frontier” sets scope outward, points blind-folded at a star map and sets off full blast without making course corrections.\n\nSince forming in 2006, Oakland’s Lumerians have gained notoriety for their intense performances, stunning live visuals and thematic otherworldly releases. Recording from their self-built studio/brewery in a converted store-front church, Lumerians acknowledge the role sound and rhythm have always played in transcendent and ecstatic rituals the world over, from the repetitious drums of tribal animists to the penetrating electronic pulses of neon dance clubs.",

  "artistSummary": "Few bands have the ability to evoke an old-school throwback vibe and yet sound entirely fresh and new at the same time. Royal Jelly is one of those bands. Combining elements of Soul, Rock, Swing and Hip-Hop, Royal Jelly shakes up any dance-party and grooves harder than your typical rock n' roll band dares to go. Fronted by the enigmatic singer Lauren Bjelde, who brings a one-of-a-kind sultry voice to her magnetic stage presence, Royal Jelly leans on the sounds of swingin' horns, gritty keys and a bumpin' rhythm section to carry a crowd into bliss... creating an unforgettable live experience that will leave you wanting more. \nBattlehooch\nBattlehooch is the kind of band you thought went extinct with landline phones & cassette tapes. In one sense they’re a band from another, sturdier era: a band that releases consistently quality material on a consistent basis, a band that doesn’t sacrifice creative drive for commercial interest, a band that grows and evolves with each successive release. From the beautiful madcap mess of debut LP Piecechow to the more refined yet still quite zany jams on Hot Lungs to a cool, polished psych-rock sheen on 2014’s Wink EP, Battlehooch has proven itself as a band built to last. They may possess an old-school mindset, but their music is weird & diverse enough to fit into this wild new century.\n\nFormed in San Francisco, the birthplace of psychedelia, it’s fitting that the six-piece collective echoes the city’s tie-dyed past in its own compositions. However, the group isn’t content with becoming a mere tribute to a time period they never lived through.

  "artistSummary": "Pegi Young & The Survivors\nPegi Young’s powerful new album, Raw, gets right to the point. Opening cut “Why” kicks off with Young’s impassioned alto, demanding, “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean?” Over the soulful Americana rock of her band the Survivors – led by legendary keyboardist/songwriter Spooner Old- ham – Young taps into a surprisingly primal force.\n\nThere’s a reason for that. Young wrote most of Raw in the wake of her 2014 sepa- ration and divorce from Neil Young, to whom she’d been married thirty-six years. Over the decades, the pair had raised a family, made music together, and worked to support northern California’s Bridge School for severely disabled children. Pegi founded the Bridge School in 1986 after being unable to find the right kind of care for their son, Ben, who has cerebral palsy.\n\n“[Raw] was very cathartic for me,” Young says. “What happened was real, but I also look at this record as having a universal quality to it. I’m certainly not the only one to go through a late-in-life divorce, and I’m not going to be the last. But in my case, it was so painful because we’d shared so many years building a life, together, weathering its ups and downs.\n\nYet the songs – most co-written with guitarist Kelvin Holly and Oldham – aren’t all expressions of anger. The first track to be released from the album is “Too Lit- tle Too Late,” a raw and poetic psalm of regret, the truth-tellin’ “Gave My Best to You” and a rockin’ update on “These Boots are Made for Walkin’” convey resili- ence and sass. A gorgeous, stripped-down version of Don Henley’s “The Heart of the Matter” explores the grace of forgiveness. As a whole, the album is a journey from shock, to rage, to sadness, to strength, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nYoung sees Raw as the soundtrack to the seven stages of grief. “It’s not a linear process,” she says. “You bounce back and forth. And each song could be sung by either party.”\n\nIn addition to chronicling this new chapter of her life, Raw also reflects the music Young has been drawn to since growing up in northern California in the 1960s. “Yes, I remember dancing in the living room to Motown,” she says. “I’ve always loved harmonies, lyrics, and rhythm. I used to go to the Fillmore and the Avalon and Winterland.”\n\nAlthough it would be decades before she would take her work to the stage, Young was writing poetry in grade school and studying it in college. She picked up an acoustic and taught herself some chords and folk covers, and became a bona fide hippie nomad: hitchhiking around the country, with stops in Vermont and Cana- da. By 1972, she’d settled down with her dog in a teepee in northern California. “I bought it for $200,” she says. “My first home.” In 1974, she was working in a res- taurant and living in the teepee when she met Neil Young.\n\nThe rock & roll road, family life, tending to the Young children, and the creation and operation of the Bridge School kept her busy. But by the early ‘aughts, Young, having toured with her ex-husband and spent time in the studio with the best of the best, was ready to become a recording artist in her own right, encouraged by Neil’s longtime manager Elliot Roberts. Two songs written during “the teepee years” ultimately graced her eponymous 2007 debut album. “I mostly set out to do covers,” Young says of that collection. “I was really shy about breaking out my own songs, but about three days into it, my guitarist original lead guitarist, An- thony Crawford convinced me to bring in my stuff.” The country-rock-tinged al- bum also marked her first recorded work with Spooner Oldham and the late pe- dal steel icon Ben Keith, both of whom she’d sang alongside on Neil’s tours. They formed the original core of Pegi Young and the Survivors.\n\nRaw features Oldham and several more recent Survivors, including Muscle Shoals-based guitarist Kelvin Holly, a veteran of Little Richard’s band; drummer Phil Jones; and the newest “Survivor” Shonna Tucker (Drive-By Truckers), who’ve added soulful muscle to the sonic texture. The group lost their original Bassist the renown Rick Rosas in 2014.\n\n“With Kelvin in the band, we’re going to a place in my wheelhouse, more R & B stuff, like Otis Clay’s ‘Trying to Live My Life Without You,’ which also has the great horn sounds [from the TexiCali Horns] and harmonies of the girl groups I listened to as a kid.”\n\nOf her five albums, Raw is the first on which Young is credited with production duties. Her M.O: “Be authentic, be true, sing what’s in your heart. It’s not about making it perfect, it’s about letting it be real, sometimes raw and flawed, as long as it’s true.” This also includes highlighting her band, the Survivors, whose cama- raderie she credits with strengthening and inspiring her. That is most evident on unabashed rocker “You Won’t Take My Laugh Away From Me,” a defiant strut of hard-won confidence that ends with Young’s joyful laughter.\n\n“My laugh has always been rather distinctive,” Young says. “It’s something I can hold on to that’s still mine.” As for the future, Young has started work on a mem- oir and making plans for a tour around Raw’s release. “I am a survivor,” she re- lates. “Although we named the band The Survivors after Ben Keith died, We didn’t have any idea some ten years ago, what an apt name it would turn out to be! I’ve gone through a lot of good stuff and scary stuff, and I will keep going for-ward.”",

  "artistSummary": "Cosmonauts came into being in 2009 in outer space or Orange County, depending on the way you like to look at things. The band was originally formed by Derek Cowart and Alexander Ahmadi after he heard Cowart play a Spaceman3 song solo at a show in their home town of Fullerton, CA. The two were students at different high schools but as it turned out, of the same musical school of thought: two lovers of lo-fi, adorers of the atmospheric, kindred pop-loving spirits. The two bonded over the Velvet Underground and Brian Jonestown Massacre, and quickly turned their mutual appreciation club into a band. Cosmonauts have been making music ever since, picking up bassist James Sanderson and a host of different drummers along the way (the spot is currently filled by Mark Morones). Now residing in Los Angeles, they’ve put out a number of releases (including three full length albums) through Burger Records and various other labels.\n\nThey’ve toured extensively through the US and Europe, and played alongside Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Pixies, Slowdive, Black Lips, Belle & Sebastian, and more, though Cosmonauts don’t exactly fit neatly into the fabric of their scene: too psychedelic to be punk, too punk to be psychedelic, and too absorbed in making their own brand of music to care.\n\nTheir latest offering, A-OK!, is out August 19th via Burger Records. \nThe Molochs\nFirst, let’s meet Moloch. You remember him, right? The ancient god, the child eater, the demander of sacrifice, the villain in Ginsberg’s Howl(and also real life) and now the personal antagonist of singer and songwriter Lucas Fitzsimons, who named his band the Molochs because he knew he’d have to make sacrifices to get what he needed, and because he always wanted a reminder of the Ginsbergian monster he’d be fighting against. And so this is how you make a record right now: you fight for every piece, and when Moloch takes apart your relationships and career potential and leaves you sleeping on couches or living in terrifying apartments and just about depleted from awful people involving you in their awful decisions, you grab a bottle of wine (and laugh at the cliché) and put together another song. And once you do that eleven hard-won times in total, you get a record like America’s Velvet Glory: honest, urgent, desperate and fearless because of it.\n\nFitzsimons came to his calling in an appropriately mythic way, born in a historic city not far from Buenos Aires and raised in L.A.’s South Bay—just outside of Inglewood—where he was immersed in the hip-hop hits on local radio. (Westside Connection!) The summer d before he started middle school, a close friend got an electric guitar, and Fitzsimons felt an enirresistible inexplicable power: “I'd go back home and I’d look up guitar chords on the internet—even though I had no guitar—and just imagine how I WOULD play them. I was slowly getting obsessed.” When he was 12, his parents took him back to Argentina, and on the first night, he discovered a long-forgotten almost-broken classical guitar in the basement of his ancestral home: “It sounds made-up, but it’s true,” he says. “I didn't put the guitar down once that whole trip—took it with me everywhere and played and played. When I got back to L.A., I bought my first guitar practically as the plane was landing.”\n\nThis started a long line of bands and a long experience of learning to perform in public, as Fitzsimons honed intentions and ideas and tried to figure out why that guitar seemed so important. After a trip to India in 2012, he returned renewed and ready to start again, scrapping his band to lead something new and uncompromising. This was the true start of the Molochs: “It didn't make any sense to not do everything exactly the way I wanted to do it,” he says. “I was so shy and introverted that singing publicly sounded like a nightmare come true. But I didn't have a choice—I heard something inside of me and I needed to be the one to express it.”\n\nThe first album Forgetter Blues was released with Fitzsimons’ guitarist/organist and longtime bandmate Ryan Foster in early 2013 on his own label—named after a slightly infamous intersection in their then-home of Long Beach—and was twelve songs of anxious garage-y proto-punk-y folk-y rock, Modern Lovers demos and Velvet Underground arcana as fuel and foundation both. It deserved to go farther than it did, which sadly wasn’t very far. But it sharpened Fitzsimons and his songwriting, and after three pent-up years of creativity, he was ready to burst. So he decided to record a new album in the spirit of the first, and in the spirit of everything that the Molochs made so far: “I wanted to spend less time figuring out HOW we were gonna do something and just actually do it.”\n\nThe result is America’s Velvet Glory, recorded with engineer Jonny Bell at effortless (says Fitzsimons) sessions at Long Beach’s JazzCats studio. (Also incubator for Molochs’ new labelmates Wall of Death and Hanni El Khatib.) It starts with an anxious electric minor-key melody and ends on a last lonesome unresolved organ riff, and in between comes beauty, doubt, loss, hate and even a moments or two of peace. There are flashes of 60s garage rock—like the Sunset Strip ’66 stormer “No More Cryin’” or the “Little Black Egg”-style heartwarmer-slash-breaker “The One I Love”—but like one of Foster’s and Fitzsimons’ favorites the Jacobites, the Molochs are taking the past apart, not trying to recreate it.\n\nYou can hear where songs bend, where voices break, where guitars start to shiver and when strings are about to snap; on “You And Me,” you can almost hear Lou Reed’s ghost call for a solo, and on “I Don’t Love You,” you get that subway-sound guitar and find out what happens when Jonathan Richman’s G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N goes wrong. And of course there’s the charismatic chaos of bootleg basement-tape Dylan—always Dylan, says Fitzsimons—and the locked-room psychedelia of Syd Barrett, especially on “Charlie’s Lips,” Fitzsimons’ ode to—or antidote to—those times when he felt the bleakness completely: “Then a bird lands on a branch nearby, you hear leaves fluttering, you hear a child laughing … all of a sudden things don't seem so bad anymore.”\n\nSo Moloch might still be out there, devouring his sacrifices, but the Molochs are still fighting, too. And that’s why Fitzsimons picked the band name—it’s so he remembers what he’s up against. He’s not celebrating the destroyer of youth and individuality and creativity, he says: “I’m just keeping him in sight so that he doesn't win.” – Christopher Ziegler \nMax Gardener\nMax Gardener makes his self-described “bedroom theme music” amidst the solitude of his California bedroom, and he intends for you to hear it in the solitude of yours.\n\nOn debut record Memory Lounge [Sports Day Records and Citrus City Records], Gardener drifts forth, mixing the sunny trademarks of sixties psych and nostalgia-inducing guitar pop hooks with his omnipresent optimism and a healthy dose of melancholy.\n\n“I was in a weird place,” he says of the recording process, conducted entirely in the privacy of his Long Beach home. “I’d be stuck in my room, recording for a whole day, just drinking coffee and kind of going crazy.”\n\nThe result is a series of kaleidoscopic songs about times past and the days ahead. Memory Lounge contains sparkling multitudes: songs for the beachside happy endings of a teen movie, long nights spent dreaming alone, or endless summer evenings with friends. A lilting guitar bounces along the radiant “Space for the Memories.” On “He Still Loves Her,” Gardener spins bittersweet longing into a shimmering melody reminiscent of The Kinks, The Shins, and The Radio Dept.",

Shortly before releasing their first single \"Demo\" in 2014 the duo became a four piece, with close friend, ex guitar player and singer Ade Martín on bass and one of their first fans, Amber Grimbergen on drums. During the rest of the year and throughout 2015 they embarked on their first world tour, playing everywhere from Thailand, Vietnam and Australia to the United States to the worldwide festival circuit,including SXSW (in which they played 16 concerts in just 4 days), Glastonbury and Burgerama. They have received very positive reviews in Pitchfork, Pigeons and Planes, Gorilla vs. Bear, Paste, SPIN, Entertainment Weekly and NME.Their debut album, Leave Me Alone, made its way into the world on Friday, January 8, 2016 via Mom + Pop Music.Fresh off their release, Hinds is receiving praise for their work. \"This great garage-rock crew from Madrid folds decades of naïf-rock history into its craftily shambling tunes,\" said Rolling Stone. Pitchfork suggests its \"[Carlotta] Cosials and [Ana] Perrote's shared vocal responsibilities, which fit perfectly together\" that \"truly set Hinds apart.\" Entertainment Weekly calls Hinds \"...the year's buzziest indie breakout,\" while SPIN asks \"Whether seeing Hinds live, or listening to their debut album, Leave Me Alone, one question always comes to mind: Can I join?\"",

It is a marked, and some may say ma-ture, development for a band that doesn't know how to play it safe.

But writing has never been a problem for Mosshart, who composes quickly and fearlessly, rarely overthinking, just letting the songs move through her, inspired by an overheard conversation, a mood, a person, or just the sound her turn indicator makes while she is guiding her muscle car through traffic. What takes the most time is writing separately and turning it into a cohesive whole. Mosshart expounds, “If ‘Ash & Ice’ were a painting, it would be incredibly complex.

Like Syd Barrett or Nick Drake before him, Pete Doherty and Alex Turner after him, Ashcroft is one of those rarified rock eccentrics; the type of visionary spirit that’s one of England’s greatest musical exports. As the frontman of The Verve, Ashcroft was the signature voice of 1990s English pop music. The band’s global megahit “Bittersweet Symphony” – which Chris Martin famously called “the best song ever written, sung by the best singer in the world” – made them stars in the States and heroes at home. He’s played Saturday Night Live, graced the cover of Rolling Stone, been nominated for VMAs, GRAMMY’s, and The Mercury Prize but he’s never made a soul record with a hot shot hip-hop producer and venerated Motown greats, until now. In 2009, Ashcroft disbanded The Verve and focused on writing songs inspired by his love of soul, funk and gospel. The result is his first solo album in four years, United Nations Of Sound.",

  "artistSummary": "When it comes to throwing a party, the Pimps of Joytime raise the bar with swagger to spare. Rhythms and textures drawn from New Orleans funk, 90s club house, 60s salsa and hip­hop all collide and fracture upon one another on their new LP, Jukestone Paradise. Dubbed “raucous and captivating” by Okayplayer, their album cuts play like the soundtrack for a ride through Brooklyn’s diverse neighborhoods, where the group’s sound materialized. And the Pimps’ live experience only takes it higher. Over the past decade, the group’s grassroots following mobilized from the underground club scene in New York to sell out historic venues like the Fillmore in San Francisco and showcase at festivals across the US and Europe. With more than 1 million Spotify plays to date, it seems word truly does spread to the wise. And when you pair high­caliber musicianship with rhythm and groove as universally enticing as it is unconventional, there’s no denying the dancefloor. \n\nMarchFourth MarchFourth is a joy-inducing force of entertainment. This colorful explosion of brassy funk, rock, and jazz emanates from musicians, acrobats, stilters and more, touring the country year-round, taking audiences on a booty-shaking, soul-stirring journey that defies categorization. Fifteen MarchFourth musicians traveled from Portland, Oregon to New Orleans, Louisiana to record their fourth studio album, MAGIC NUMBER. With Producer Ben Ellman (Galactic) and Engineer/Producer Mikael “Count” Eldridge (DJ Shadow, Tycho, Galactic, Trombone Shorty) at the helm, the album is full of the captivating grooves and brassy swagger you’d expect from M4, plus a healthy dose of New Orleans magic, with guest appearance by Trombone Shorty, Stanton Moore (drums), and Matt Perrine (sousaphone). The album was fan-funded through Kickstarter (out September 30, 2016). \n\n“Perfectly merging the artistic spirit of Portland with the musical spectacle of New Orleans, MarchFourth put on one of the most complete shows of any band on any stage. From rocking big band jam tunes, choreography and feats of strength that need to be seen to be believed, MarchFourth entertains on every level every second they are on the stage…or off!” ~Rex Thomson, Live for Live Music “From the first note to the last, the sound was pumping and the fun never stopped… It’s worth noting that there are serious musicians behind all the fun. I was a music major in college and it’s obvious these guys (and gals) have had lots of training and formal practice. Talented band geeks turned rebels. When one of the horn players steps up to improvise a solo, you know it’s going to be a treat.” ~ Tim Leffel, USAToday “You could call MarchFourth a Vaudeville circus, or a sexy carnivalesque sideshow of animalistic proportions where all sense of decorum is beaten into submission. I call it a panoply for the senses, a celebratory feast of friends, a visually stunning performance that sears itself into your brain.” ~Mike Greenblatt, The Aquarian",

  "artistSummary": "What does deep house, the work of Stockhausen, a self-programmed snake and a frozen Lily Cole have in common? No, it’s not the contents of a lost episode of Skins. Nor is it the XX’s Christmas list. It is, rather, just a few of the details that make up Clean Bandit, a new four-piece that in their playfulness and willingness to trample over musical boundaries offer a refreshing new direction for dance music in 2013. Forget your rock revivalists or your retrofitted soul crooners, Clean Bandit could not have emerged at any time other than now. Comprised of brothers Jack and Luke Patterson alongside the classically-trained pair of Grace Chatto and Neil Amin-Smith, the group formed in 2008. One night , in the dingy confines of a Cambridge nightclub, classic music met bass music, and it never looked back. “It was at the band’s own club night called National Rail Disco. We set it up because we thought there was a real lack of new interesting music at the time. The first ever one was basically set up so we could perform. But as it carried on it became more of a straightforward club night we DJ’d or played live most weeks alongside other DJs and electronic acts we loved.” The students, not normally thought to be a particularly clubby kind of crowd, were into it. “They loved it, it was really successful and always completely packed”, says Jack. “People didn’t expect the students to be into it, but they were. They all had a real appetite for the music. One of the coolest things was the night we had James Blake down. Three quarters of the way through his set he just played a Destiny’s Child acapella on its own. Even though there was no beat,. people just went completely off. That was amazing.” National Rail Disco provided Clean Bandit with a blueprint for everything that was to follow. First, there was a willingness to take risks. Second a desire to blend beats and strings. Third, it was done in a DIY fashion, using whatever resources were to hand.â€¨But first they decided to move to Moscow. Grace to learn the language and play cello. Jack followed her, and ended up enrolling in Russia’s famous film school, The Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. “I didn’t have much to do in Moscow and someone mentioned a film course that was open to international students so I thought I’d give it a try. It was a five year course,” Jack recalls. “I didn’t do the whole thing, but the whole of the first year you only do black and white still images. In the second year you do moving images but still only in black and white. It was all in Russian too, and to begin with none of the students spoke a word of it.” It was at the Gerasimov that Jack’s ideas of blending music recordings with filmmaking began to take shape. “I was making music on a laptop a lot while I was there”, he says. “It was still a hobby though. I had long days at film school and then would come home and have a go messing around making music. I wrote Mozart’s House while I was out there. I was listening to a lot of house music there, there was a little boutique outside our flat that would blast out house for 24 hours. Maybe that seeped in.” Now, in 2013, Clean Bandit are still mixing things up. Currently residing in London, this electroquartet are applying their principles to a whole new range of possibilities. Listen to single ‘A&E’ and you’ll hear classical, bucolic strings intertwining with UK funky bass and a melody of modern electronic pop. It’s a new sophisticated sound, but one that’s distinctive of our capital. The soulful vocals, meanwhile, are sung by guests Kandaka Moore and Nikki Marshall, found by chance in the group’s new home of Kilburn. “They were part of local community singing and dancing group next door to our studio”, says Jack. “We thought they would be perfect for this track.” And so they are, sharing the enthusiasm of the track and, also, the versatility of the group. Moore also volunteered as a dancer for the video, which necessitated her being part of a stop-motion animation. “She was completely unfazed by being painted gold over the course of two hours”, notes Jack. That was far from being the most complicated part of the production, by the way. The video for A&E also required the creation of a golden snake. A serpent that, as in a real life game of Snake, slithered across central London. It was a challenge, one that Jack – typically – took it upon himself to rise to. So how do you make a snake? “We made it on the computer”, he says. “I taught myself to use Cinema 4D. I studied architecture at uni, so I had kind of got into 3d graphics, modeling and animation. Luke learned how to do the fluid dynamics, because the snake had to go through water at the beginning.” Clean Bandit have also been getting a taste of a different experience closer to home whilst on tour this spring with teenage chart conquerors Disclosure. “The tour was really fun”, says Jack. “It was great to see how that world worked and to be in these really cool clubs up and down the country was brilliant. There were screaming fans. We had people who knew the words to our songs, which was quite amazing to see. It was unexpected.”â€¨The stakes were raised even higher for new single ‘Dust Clears’. This concept video, also directed by Jack, was half-filmed on the frozen lakes of northern Sweden in winter. “In this video all the band work in a factory, but the lead singer is an older guy who’s got this fantasy of being an ice skater”, says Jack, with a smile. “We filmed the skating in Sweden and that was great, we used some special techniques. Two of us were towed along on a sled with two different lenses, two cameras filming our dear friend Nick as he skated past. Nick is our friend’s dad and while we were thinking about making the video we heard that when he was 17 he was a Scottish figure skating champion. When you see the video, you’ll see why we found this quite amazing.” Quite clearly kids of the internet generation, Clean Bandit aren’t precious about where they find inspiration or how they deploy it (the aforementioned Lily Cole volunteered to stand in a freezing cold swimming pool for the video to UK Shanty, in return for Jack giving her a tutorial on her new video camera). Neither are they devoted to one type of creativity. They make music, they make video, they perform live. “We try to think of each piece as being a music video rather than a song”, says Jack. “Videos for songs is the output. That’s how we’d like it to be digested. Now we’re doing more and more music, we’re having to make stuff without the videos, but hopefully we’ll be able to catch up.”",

It turns out, though, that once the door’s open, it never closes. That’s because the Melbourne septet has ingeniously crafted what may be the world’s first infinitely looping LP. Each of the nine, complex, blistering tracks on ‘Nonagon Infinity’ seamlessly flows into the next, with the final song linking straight back into the top of the opener like a sonic mobius strip. It’s exactly the kind of ambitious vision that prompted Rolling Stone to dub the band “one of the most compelling collectives of art-rock experimentalists in recent years.” But far from a simple conceptual experiment, the album is both an exhilarating shot of adrenaline and a remarkable feat of craftsmanship, the result of painstaking planning and an eye for detail years in the making.",

  "artistSummary": "Alycia Lang\nIf you’re a fan of indie rock in the bay area, chances are you’ve heard and appreciated the vocal contributions of Alycia Lang without even realizing it. Whether providing lush vocals and instrumentation in Bay Area favorite, Waterstrider, or sneaking in vocal cameos in any number of other bay area bands, she’s been lending her talents to projects since 2013 when when she re-emerged from a 3-year hiatus and landed in the vibrant music and art scene in Oakland. \n\nAfter years singing classical music with the San Francisco Conservatory Of Music in her youth, her early recordings earned her praise from several notable producers and artists, which lead to the creation of her debut album in 2006 in the UK. In the years that followed, Alycia found herself writing original material for the first time and collaborating with Grammy Award winning producers, writers, and engineers to create two EPs of original music which were released in 2008 and 2011.\n\nIn part, due to her eclectic musical career, Alycia’s music now lands at the unlikely intersection of alternative folk, pop, jazz and indie rock, a combination which has earned her comparisons to artists like Joni Mitchell, Norah Jones and Justin Vernon. Driven by soaring vocals, yet centered around mindfully crafted lyrics, her music creates a synergy that is strikingly emotive, insidiously catchy and achingly poignant.\n\nIn 2011, in a dramatic departure from her musical past, Alycia wiped the slate clean by taking almost all of her music offline and going on a 3 year hiatus to focus on her visual art. Now, in a return to her musical roots, where the human voice and the words it carries reign, she plans to present new recorded material in late 2016/early 2017 that will surely have the influence of her eclectic musical past woven in its threads.",

Belting out rocking blues from France to the eastern states and Canada with her band “Blue Heat”, her special blend of hard rocking blues, gospel and roots brought out a voice unique in its depth, universal in its world weariness.\n\nAfter a long break working in the non-profit world, Lembo is coming back with a fury. Her voice, preserved in the break continues to evolve and reflects the depth of life and the world around us. She has spent the last several years writing her 5th release titled “45 Miles”and will begin recording in the summer of 2015.\n\nWhen asked to sum up her last 15 years, Lembo says this: “The purpose of my semi-retirement from music was to discover who I am off the stage. I had spent most of my life prior either on the stage or, trying to get on it. The irony is, the work I was doing often times brought me on stage to talk with hundreds or even, thousands of people. I guess it is just who I am. That said, I’m much more interested in evolving and growing as a musician than trying to be a rock star. I’m fascinated by how music heals, moves, motivates and brings us together in community. It is a spiritual quest now, the wannabe rock star days behind me. I wasn’t very good at it anyway. I’m much better at being part of the whole of the experience as opposed to being the focus. ”\n\nLook for Lembo’s upcoming album, “45 Miles” 2016.",

  "artistSummary": "Tim Cohen\nTim Cohen wants make you aware of life’s imperfections; he likes to play devil’s advocate…or maybe he's more like the devil’s buddy, offering up his own dark but playful asides. On Luck Man, the Fresh & Only’s and Magic Trick frontman’s first solo record for Sinderlyn, Cohen has created a lush, insular world that deals with the uneasiness of accepting life’s inherent flaws. \n\nRecorded in his attic and at El Studio in San Francisco after recently moving back to a city he longed called home, Luck Man is a personal statement distilled from Cohen’s own experiences. “I draw upon little moments and memories to make music,” he says. “I like to think I’m leaving bits of wisdom behind, but I don’t possess the wisdom for longer than it takes to make a song. I inherit it momentarily, write it down, attach a melody that fits the words in rhythm, and then record it.” Attempting to answer the unanswerable, Cohen aims to fill this existential void with his songwriting.\n\nThe intricacies of tracks like “I Need A Wife” and \"John Hughes\" belie Cohen’s seemingly simple writing process where warmth and comfort meets a questioning anxiety. However, there's always more to each song than meets the eye. Influenced by Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece as well as his one-time day job as a delivery driver (see \"Meat Is Murder\") and other daily travails, Cohen eschews focusing on overarching topics like love, hope or despair and, instead, creates his own stories with fleeting, yet quietly complex characters and thoughts. \n\nAfter over a decade of writing and releasing music under various monikers, it's clear that Cohen is more than capable of producing a beautiful record, whether or not you want to dig deeper into life's nagging paradoxes is solely up to you.",

Enamored of her mother’s rock- and soul-heavy music collection, she sang throughout school, picking up guitar, bass and songwriting as a teenager. She earned her GED and left high school early, then pursued music studies at the local junior college. A period of woodshedding, gigging and recording ensued, culminating in the release of Pi’s debut album. She spent two years in New York before landing in L.A., which has proven fertile creative ground and a convenient base for touring. \"A Little Blue\" is Pi’s seventh record, coming March 31, 2017 on The Travianna Records label. \n\nA LITTLE BLUE\n\nOn tour in late 2016, in the tiny town of Floyd, VA. Pi met the head of Mountain Fever Records, the premiere US bluegrass label. Mark Hodges, the president of Mountain Fever, immediately signed Pi to his new Americana label, Travianna Records. In between European and US touring last year, Pi went out to Floyd to work with Producer and multi-instrumentalist, Aaron Ramsey. The result is a true collaboration of Pi's “Americana bluesy rock thing,” and Aaron's deep bluegrass roots. A truly unique album, \"A Little Blue\" will be released in March of 2017. We can't wait!",

There's a deep rooted tradition of folk music with messages of protest, praise, love & loss, and on Tipping Point they continue this tradition, struggling through their art to parse out the how’s and why’s of human behavior and its consequence to the world we share.\n\nFormed in June of 2013 by three talented singer/songwriters: Matt Ducey, Jenny Weaver and James Addison, The Battlefield speaks to the conflicts in our hearts & minds as well as the daily struggles of modern life. This world is a Battlefield and we’re in it together.\n\nA harmony-filled addition to the halls of American songwriting, Tipping Point is the sound of three unique voices and styles coming together to form one powerful piece of music. Built on a foundation of impeccable songwriting, the record is a timeless, yet undeniably modern, portrait of the human condition.\n\nSince its release, they have toured the country extensively playing bars, house concerts, music halls & festivals - 18 states & counting... Early 2017 finds them back in the studio to begin recording their follow-up record before hitting the road again this Spring.",

From Phoenix to NYC and from Boston to South Florida to Scotland, she's toured as a mostly-solo act, collecting stories and creating musical vignettes while headlining at nationally recognized venues such as Club Passim, The Bitter End, and The Freight and Salvage.\n\nGarlin started her career as a school teacher. All the while there has been another call to adventure, a tugging on the guitar strings that has moved her to write and record and tour and perform. Her April 2015 release, Wink at July, continues in the folk-rock storytelling vein that brought her accolades from the New York Songwriter’s Circle, Performing Songwriter Magazine, and won her first place in the Newport Folk Festival’s Talent Search. Media fans include Curve Magazine (“storytelling at its best” ) and Diffuser Magazine (“an impressive catalogue of unforgettable stories.”) Garlin’s songs have also aired on Click and Clack's Car Talk, NPR’s Democracy Now, and radio stations throughout the country. Her live performances bring together a natural stage presence and the same folk, rock, and Americana flavors that season her recordings.",

They give modern attitude to old-time music, blending bluegrass, country, rock and roll, folk, and traditional music in original acoustic arrangements.\n\nJosh Johnson and Reese Douglas share singing and songwriting duties, trading off on guitar and banjo. Josh writes thoughtful narratives, combining strong bluegrass and traditional roots with elements of folk-pop that make his songs catchy and unforgettable. Reese writes foot stomping country and rock and roll tunes that say it straight and make people move. Brendan Getzell puts the shine on top with his effortless mandolin and vocal harmonies, and Adam Thompson keeps it all steady on the upright bass. Their most obvious influences would be Neil Young, Earl Scruggs, the Byrds, Uncle Dave Macon, Joni Mitchell, Bela Fleck, Soundgarden, and Jerry Jeff Walker, but they also take cues from jazz, classical, and a wide variety of folk traditions.",

  "artistSummary": "There’s something romantic about a band’s early days. A sense of innocence, optimism, and wonder courses through the music. In the summer of 2014, No Doubt’s Tony Kanal [bass], Tom Dumont [guitar], and Adrian Young [drums] and singer Davey Havok [AFI, Blaqk Audio] began writing and demoing music together. Without telling a soul outside of their significant others, the four musicians clandestinely moved into a cramped downtown Los Angeles rehearsal spot and revved up what would become DREAMCAR.\n“It reminded me of the early days of No Doubt when we were jamming in an Orange County garage,” recalls Dumont. “We felt that same sense of freedom. There was no label, no manager, no agent, and no roadies.”\n“For a good year-and-a-half, it was just the four of us making music,” adds Kanal. “We had this opportunity to be a new band again. That’s a very special thing to be able to do. We were just making music to make music.”\nThe union of Kanal, Dumont, Young, and Havok pre-dates those magical jam sessions. Paths crossed in the music industry as they do, but Young can recall standing on the side of the stage and watching Havok with rapt attention as Blaqk Audio opened for No Doubt in 2012. “Davey was super charismatic,” says the drummer. “It was powerful to watch.”\n“He was fearless to come from the punk world and do something that flies totally in the face of that,” agrees Dumont. “We found that sense of bravery exciting. We didn’t ever want to be constrained by unspoken rules of a scene or anything like that, and he was like-minded.”\nWhen Havok heard the first four demos, the music immediately resonated, transporting him back to his childhood fascination with the celebrated New Romantic movement. “It was very fun, because the songs touched on an aspect of my creative inspiration and musical upbringing that has never been directly touched on before,” admits Havok. “When it comes to some of the most informative musical moments for me, Duran Duran and Culture Club were the earliest cassette tapes I ever bought.”\nRife with shimmering guitar tones, percussive slap bass, bombastic drums, and a neon-lit dancefloor dreaminess, DREAMCAR gleefully nods to the decade of Boy George and Back to the Future through a kaleidoscope of wisdom earned from three decades creating and connecting with fans worldwide. Signing to Columbia Records, the boys are finishing off recording their 2017 self-titled debut with producer Tim Pagnotta [Neon Trees] in a North Hollywood studio.\n“DREAMCAR speaks to a nostalgia, but as much as it speaks to the past, it also speaks to the present and the future,” Havok goes on. “It mirrors hopes, aspirations, and attaining the unattainable. I would hope the songs do the same thing.”\n“On the surface, a dream car is a very male ideal,” says Dumont. “You think of that question, ‘What’s your dream car?’ Everyone will have a different answer. If you go a little deeper, it’s like a vehicle for dreams.”\nUltimately, it’s that combination of delectable and dangerous which will leave listeners everywhere satisfied. “This is a big moment for us,” Kanal leaves off. “It’s a new beginning. We can’t wait to perform the songs live!”\n“I’d love for people to get a cinematic feeling,” concludes Young. “If they hear it and want to see us live, that would be amazing. Let the dream begin.”\nTICKET INFORMATION• Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue.• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

Their latest offering is entitled A Conspiracy Of Stars, was cut by rock legend  and breathes that typically British easy-going confidence for which this band has been known for over 45 years. A strong release consisting of eleven songs which combine everything that the group surrounding frontman Phil Mogg stands for: meaty riffs, distinctive hooks, diverse songwriting, intelligent lyrics and that generally laid-back attitude which we have associated with UFO from the start. The fact that A Conspiracy Of Stars was produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore, among others) may be considered another successful element in a thoroughly consistent release. To cut a long story short: their 22nd studio recording to date sees UFO prove that past and present can be blended in a homogeneous whole.",

There was the music to get to; itself essentially reference-less and unqualifiedly unique. But what of the guy who created it? The guitarist who wrote the whole thing, who played every instrument. An enormous unknown talent without an attendant backstory to match the spectral and boundless qualities of his music. Enter Chuck Klosterman. The celebrated writer was brought on to completely fabricate a biography based on a band and album he was asked not to listen to.",

But apparently an all-for-one philosophy of songwriting and identity is an anomaly in the modern era of music. \n \nRecorded in a marathon one-week session at Studio 606, \"Above Snakes\" finds San Francisco's Down and Outlaws fine-tuning their place musically and striving to channel the restless, pissed off spirits of rock and roll history. \n \nAs Above Snakes -- an old west term meaning \"still alive\" -- suggests, the band believes in music that's fresh, yet pleasantly unpolished; brash, but wary; accessible, but never cheap. \n \nIn \"I Don't Care,\" Peter Danzig proclaims: \"I'm a sickness/ I'm a cheat/ I don't care if I feel a thing.\" And the whole band joins in to scream the title line with an urgency that proves just the opposite. \n \nWith appearances at Outsidelands, SXSW, Noise Pop, and Echo Park Rising under their belt, the band's show is the source and primary outlet of that urgency. A friend recently commented, \"I've been trying to record your set for months, but you're too fuckin' loud!\" This music is based on freedom and escape from everything else that drags you down, if only for 40 minutes. \n \n\"Raw energy, blistering guitar leads and dirty vocals over thick bass lines and driving drums. Though their aesthetic is dark and brooding, they write songs that are smartly accessible.\" — San Franpsycho (Bands You Need to Know)\n\n\ndownandoutlaws.com\n\n\nMaszer (Members of Reignwolf)\n\n\nFrom guttered with tears in a 70's van to the glorious nights under the moon we bring you MASZER!

  "artistSummary": "Time: 9:00pm \n\n Day: Thursday \n\n \n Ages: 21+ Ages \n \n Price: $20\n\n\n\nSince his stunning debut, Thunderstorms and Neon Signs in 1995, Wayne “The Train” Hancock has been the undisputed king of Juke Joint Swing - that alchemist’s dream of honky-tonk, western swing, blues, Texas rockabilly and big band. Always an anomaly among his country music peers, Wayne’s uncompromising interpretation of the music he loves is in fact what defines him: steeped in traditional but never \"retro;\" bare bones but bone shaking; hardcore but with a swing.\n\n\nLike the comfortable crackle of a Wurlitzer 45 jukebox, Wayne is the embodiment of genuine, house rocking, hillbilly boogie. Wayne makes music fit for any road house anywhere. With his unmistakable voice, The Train’s reckless honky-tonk can move the dead. If you see him live (and he is ALWAYS touring), you’ll surely work up some sweat stains on that snazzy Rayon shirt you’re wearing. If you buy his records, you’ll be rolling up your carpets, spreading sawdust on the hardwood floor, and dancing until the downstairs neighbors are banging their brooms on the ceiling. Call him a throwback if you want, but all Wayne Hancock wants to do, is simply ENTERTAIN you, and what's wrong with that?\n\n\nwaynehancock.com\n\n\nBig Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys\n\n\nOver the last three decades, Big Sandy and his Fly-Rite Boys have kept up a constant cycle of traveling back and forth across the lower 48, then hopping across the pond to Europe and beyond. They bring with them a brand of American music that has earned them an induction into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, several national television appearances, guest spots on The Grand Ole Opry, and a slew of adoring fans.\n \n\"I truly love being out on the road, and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to sing my songs all over the world,\" said Sandy. \"But when I'm away from the U.S. for too long, it's like I need a recharge... like I need a solid dose of everything Americana. Give me a Chuck Berry song while rolling down the interstate, or a truck stop conversation with a waitress who once danced with Lefty Frizzell, and I'm good for another three thousand miles”.\n \nbigsandy.net",

  "artistSummary": "Time: 9:00pm \n\n Day: Saturday \n\n \n Ages: 21+ Ages \n \n Price: $10\n \n\n\nOnce a thriving dairy community, Cerritos was a constantly changing environment. It was a place where you could drunkenly ride a cow through an abandoned dairy at midnight, only to find the field covered with yet another 7-11 the following week. The heavy smell of hot asphalt, ever devouring the landscape, clashed with the bitter perfume of cowshit; the asphalt always won. Here was a perfect place for punk rock to take hold, the endless tracts supplying a new house to be destroyed every weekend, the frantic rhythms providing a natural soundtrack for boredom and outrageous alcohol abuse. Friends since the third grade, Mike Magrann and Kimm Gardener soon found the inevitable guitars in their hands, though with no real idea of what to do with them. However, with their shared appreciation of a wide range of music (along with their endless quest for free beer), it wasn't long before an early version of CH3 was blasting out Blitzkrieg Bop at a kegger. They were soon playing Clash and 999 covers on the Cerritos party circuit, covering more suburban backyards than a team of Salvadoran landscapers.\n\n\nAfter learning how to write a song (and perfecting the sublime art of kicking out drummers), Kimm and Mike finally settled on the original recording lineup of CH3, with Larry Kelley on Bass and Mike Burton on Drums. The first Demo recording found its circuitous way to Robbie Fields, founder of the legendary Posh Boy Label, and a deal was hastily made. This was before the band had played a single club. The CH3 EP was released early Summer, 1981. The record received good critical notices, but the band's limited exposure kept it a modest success. This began a campaign to play every show possible, in any location that would have the band. Interest began growing, the band got better, and by the time Fear of Life was released Summer 1982, the band was ready for its first extensive U.S. tour.\n\n\nAt the time, touring the punk club circuit was a shaky proposition at best. There were lots of cancellations, lots of fights, and wherever exists a squatter's living room with an American Flag nailed to the wall, chances are CH3 slept under it! The band's constant travel probably contributed to its healthy turnover rate, and the 1983 tour in support of After the Lights Go Out saw Posh Boy Veteran Jay Lansford joining the band. Jay, a former member of the Simpletones and Stepmothers (as well as in-house producer of many Posh hits), brought to the band a new professionalism, not to mention many new hair care products. The band was at the peak of its popularity, playing to large crowds, and enjoying chart success in Europe with the I Got A Gun UK release.\n\n\nBy the mid eighties, the band was spending more time in the rehearsal studio, experimenting with a five man lineup and stretching out creatively. Airborne , the first release on Enigma records, was a stylistic departure for CH3. Many fans refer to this as the definitive dawn of the \"You guys Suck!\" phase in the band's history. That record's emphasis on song over speed (and the outrageous use of the much feared harmonica!) alienated some fans, but allowed the band to begin playing more high profile shows, supporting acts such as X, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Midnight Oil. Empowered by a new sense of artistic freedom (or maybe it was the superior backstage deli trays), CH3 then delivered Last Time I Drank in 1985, a record that many hardcore punk fans found not only a shocking display of musicianship, but also a blatant display of disrespect of all things bald, broke, and smelling of clove cigarettes. This one even had a saxophone on it for God's sake! Never fond of the strict conformity of Punk Rock's non-conformist manifesto, the band continued to explore musically. The final release of the 1980's was the aptly named Rejected, a curious mix of studio projects that sounds like a weary Amen! after a long and desperate prayer…\n\n\nThe band kept a low profile through the 90's. Besides the annual Doll Hut benefit show and the rare late night television appearance, the band had all but vanished. Oddly, the band emerged in Europe for a brief tour in 1994, with the live release How Do You Open the Damn Thing serving as a reminder of the band's powerful live performance. But the band was not done; CH3 had simply retreated to the basement lab, plotting for the inevitable return with a maniacal laugh!\n\n\nToday, CH3 finds itself back on the road, curiously playing to bigger crowds than ever. With the addition of Anthony Thompson on Bass, and the long suffering Fredo Silva pounding the skins (not to mention drumming) the band is back to the classic 4 man assault. The new self titled release on Dr Strange Records is 14 songs, all new, that ring with the original reckless spirit of classic CH3. We thank you for taking the time to catch up with us! And regardless of where it may lead us, we hope you stay along for the ride.\n\n\nchthree.com\n\n\nShattered Faith has been writing and performing original punk rock since 1979 and are recognized as pioneers in the first wave of Southern California punk rock bands (like Social Distortion, TSOL, Black Flag, Fear, Circle Jerks, & many others from the late 70's). These bands lived hard and fast, challenged authority, played loud, and ultimately defined the SoCal punk scene for generations to come.\n\n\nThe members of Shattered Faith made their mark on the scene with their dark, melodic, upbeat sound grinding out punk rock classics like 'Reagan Country', 'I Love America', 'Right is Right', and 'Trilogy'. Now with the 2 new 7” singles on Hostage Records, the band has sparked a new revival. Over the years the band has developed a loyal following that continues to this day. Now their sound is being handed down to whole new generation of kids. Together or individually they have spawned a number of Bands & Side projects over the past 35 years. Such as The U.S. Bombs, Firecracker 500, the Pushers, El Centro, Big Hippy Party, The Main, the Schitz & Bad Luck Charms, to name a few. \n \nThese guys are still churning out music & doing it with the true spirit that made them the Punk Legends they are. Shattered Faith is in a class of its own, Never conforming to what anyone else did. They know their craft & do it better than anyone.. Staying true to their sound leaving a message that is still current & will live on for generations to come.\n\n\nshatteredfaith.bandcamp.com\n\n\nCronander\n\n\nMembers of Annihilation Time, Isotope, Lecherous Gaze. \n\n\ncronander.bandcamp.com\n\n\nwartribe\n\n\nMembers of peligro social, monster squad, cost of living,double-cross, cropnox, suicidebomb and short attention span.\n\n\nwartribe82.bandcamp.com",

Bob Log III launched into a mind-blowing set, finger picking his beaten-up black guitar for a sound of steel string blues and heavy rock n' roll.

Today, with the world of music literally at our fingertips, the camp and ritual of rock n' roll has almost been forgotten, residing mainly in the stories and recordings of the past.

Utilizing hardcore, doom, and atmospheric elements, ROZAMOV create a sound reminiscent of the bleak power of Neurosis, Yob and Grief.\n\n\nROZAMOV has released two self-produced EP’s and toured the Midwest and East Coast over the past two years. The band is now in the process of writing their debut full length album and will tour extensively in 2015.\n\n\nrozamov.bandcamp.com\n\n\nBädr Vogu is a sludge/doom/crust metal band hailing from Oakland, California that was formed in late 2009. Armed with a strong DIY ethic, they have steadily built an underground following in the States through incessant touring and a spattering of releases including a self-released demo (2010), a full-length called Exitium (2011), a split LP with Seattle based death/crust outfit Wilt (2012), and a tour tape/demo titled Agglomeration MMXIV released through Transylvanian Tapes (2014). They have also established a sizable following in Europe from the release and distribution of their debut album through the Spanish death/doom label Memento Mori.\n\n\nBädr Vogu arose out of mutual friendships in the Bay Area heavy music scene and set out with the intention of creating music that would stand up to the high level of talent and integrity existent in the region's underground music scene. They are influenced by local luminaries such as Noothgrush, Dystopia, Neurosis, Sleep/Asbestos Death, Stormcrow, and Brainoil; but they also deftly infuse their sound with the bluesy swagger of the American South, conjuring forth the swampy sounds of Eyehategod, Weedeater, and Buzzov-en. Their brutal concoction is then encased in a solidified crust of filthy death/doom that has an underlying punk/hardcore backbone. \n \nBädr Vogu is comprised of Sean Sokol on vocals/samples, Bryce Shelton and Leo Buckley on guitars, Justin Wonder on drums, and Chris Tanti on bass. These native Californians have had a long, incestuous history of involvement in the underground music scene in the Bay Area and have been involved with numerous other groups such as Hotblack Desiato, World Eater, Agenda of Swine, Hazzard’s Cure, Ordo Obsidium, Dolph Lundgren, and Nik Turner’s Hawkwind, to name only a few. Following on the heels of their split 12” LP with Wilt (released on Hermit and Abominate Records), they have been steadily writing and preparing new songs for their upcoming second full length album, which will be recorded in March 2015 at Earhammer studios in Oakland by Greg Wilkinson. Their new material cohesively blends their strongest points into a massive and uncompromising slew of new songs that they feel are their most compelling and ferocious to date. \n \nAmidst their songwriting, Bädr Vogu has remained diligent in maintaining a consistent touring schedule on top of playing out locally. They have done two full US tours and a plethora of smaller regional trips up and down the West Coast and the Southwest. 2015 proves to be no different for them as they have already completed a full West Coast tour and have a string of upcoming shows lined up all throughout California and the Pacific Northwest, including appearances this summer at “California Crust-Stock” in Los Angeles, Oakland’s “Dead-Fest”, and Seattle’s “Distress Fest”. With the new album around the corner, they plan to tour extensively in support of its release both in the United States as well as abroad. Bädr Vogu has shared the stage with such heavy hitters as: Eyehategod, Black Cobra, Oathbreaker, Pallbearer, Brainoil, Samothrace, Sea of Bones, Bell Witch, Thou, Seven Sisters of Sleep, Undergang, Graves At Sea, Laudanum, Gehenna, Full of Hell, Weedeater, Noothgrush, Impaled, Hell, Atriarch, and Usnea.\n\n\nbadrvogu.bandcamp.com",

They hit the road and developed a synergy that is evident on their sophomore release, Road, Bridges, & Ruins. On this release we saw the rise of co-vocalist, Chris Matulich, who brought melody and nuance to their sound, and made them contemporaries with bands like Gaslight Anthem and The Menzingers.\n\n\nArmed with two songwriters and two singers, Nothington jumped to Chicago label Red Scare for 2011's Borrowed Time. This was a breakout release and by this time the band was so popular in Europe that they frequently made transatlantic trips and were getting tour oers from mainstream bands. But all the while Nothington stayed diligent to their craft and loyal to their core audience: the outsiders who sing along with beers held high.\n\n\n​In The End will be the first full length studio album from the band in 5 years. After playing a thousand sweaty shows and the occasional spurt of activity in the form of a 7\" or a tour with The Lawrence Arms, the band went into hibernation.

After guitarist and lead singer Katie Rose (BOMP! Records baby of les Hell on Heels) migrated down to San Francisco from Portland, Oregon with bassist Laura Svec, they eventually joined with drummer Raquel Reyes (The Peppermints) to form Dirty Denim. They swiftly made their mark in the North Bay area gigging with local and touring bands at S.F. venues such as; Great American Music Hall, Rickshaw Stop and Bottom of the Hill. This year (2016) they added a fourth badass, Niki Kangas, who juggles keyboard, guitar and tambourine.\n\n\nDirty Denim doubled down with explosive keys, catchy riffs and backup gang vocals that are impossible not to sing. Watching them go from 3 shy girls nervously giggling into microphones... to an all out WILDFIRE on stage has captivated me. Always obsessed to see what they'll do next and literally twitching to hear their FIRST FULL LENGTH RECORD (set to release this year)... I wait impatiently. Dirty Denim is now headlining local shows and supporting great bands like, The Coathangers, The Birth Defects, Shannon & the Clams and many others.

Virtually unknown outside Denver upon release, the band gathered acclaim over the ensuing months and by year end had landed in the #9 spot on Decibel Magazine’s annual top 40 albums of the year, not a small accomplishment for a band on its debut album. \n \nThe new album ‘Hunted’ reveals a Khemmis fortified in its purpose and vision, forging an unrivaled synthesis between immense Doom riffs and Maiden-esque harmony. Overall song length has increased yielding more expansively arranged and dramatic storms of elegance and melancholy. \n \nAnd yet Khemmis are not content to plod through a sea of tears, they are always a rock band first, in service to the movement of the song, even approaching a High On Fire like pace to open the pummeling \"Three Gates.\" The lauded singing of vocalist Phil Pendergast reaches ascendant new heights on tracks like \"Candlelight\" and \"Beyond The Door,\" while the tasteful use of harsh vocals remains, providing a dark foreboding contrast. The 13-minute title track once again closes the album with an epic stunner. \n \nUndoubtedly ‘Hunted’ is an album that will solidify Khemmis’ place at the vanguard of doom’s most notable modern manifestations, in large part because they transcend the label itself. They’ve seamlessly blended their influences into an extraordinarily listenable album worthy of countless spins. With such a glut of music released today, ‘Hunted’ stands apart, rewarding repeat listens with songs seared straight into the heart.\n\n\nkhemmisdoom.com\n\n\nJaye Jayle was conceived by singer/songwriter Evan Patterson (also of the band Young Widows) in late 2013. Last year, Jaye Jayle released four limited edition single 7 inches on four different record labels of 8 songs from a recording made prior to ever performing in a live setting. A new album is on the horizon. Cheers.\n\n\njayejayle.bandcamp.com",

The record was listed among Decibel Magazine’s Top 40 Albums Of 2015 and he is currently well into writing his new album as well as a new setup of machines. After leaving a career as mechanical engineer in Boston to focus on art and sculpture, Tristan Shone, the creator and sole artist behind AUTHOR & PUNISHER, moved west to pursue his MFA in Southern California. In the metal and machine shops of University of California, San Diego, Shone forged a relationship with design, sound and fabrication that ultimately yielded AUTHOR & PUNISHER‘s first music and mapped the journey away from traditional instrumentation towards custom made, precision machinery.\n\n\nShone used his technical knowledge, along with his artistic background to create what Wired Magazine has hailed as his own “special brand of doom metal.” All aspects of the AUTHOR & PUNISHER sound begin with physical movement, limbs struggling in unison to coordinate a wall of electronic rhythm and oscillation, ultimately conditioned by an organic and loose quality absent of sequencing and plastic perfection. AUTHOR & PUNISHER performances are a real amalgamation between man and mechanisms. They are direct, physical, heavy experiences that have amassed praise and intrigue from a wide array of audiences. Pitchfork styled him “immediate but mysterious,” Stereogum described his “chilling, unrecognizable form,” and NPR hails him as “a thrill [who] fires on all cylinders.”\n\n\ntristanshone.com\n\n\nBruce Lamont \n\n\nSolo project of Bruce Lamont from the avant garde metal band Yakuza.\n\n\nsoundcloud.com/at-a-loss-recordings/bruce-lamont-2-then-the-3\n\n\nSanford Parker \n\n\nsanfordparker.com",

They’ve met their wives and their best friends on these streets; they’ve grown and aged right here in the Bay Area. This has ignited the very essence of what goes into their value system and more importantly their music, because it is a reflection of those experiences. For example, the band took a break to raise their families, right at the height of their popularity! Did it faze them? Not really. Darius became a plumber. Johnny honed his drawing skills and started a screen printing business in his garage. Spike continued singing for all-star cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. No one really knows how Greg spends his time. He is sort of a mystery. That’s the thing with these guys. It is family first, with music always germinating within those life choices. During the Utters’ semi-hiatus, they all continued playing music in bands like Druglords of the Avenues, the Re-volts and Filthing Thieving Bastards. Their life experiences influence what goes into their records. A case in point is their debut: 1995’s The Streets of San Francisco; their first full length and an essential “streetpunk” masterpiece. Fat Mike took notice of their grit and honesty, and signed them to Fat Wreck Chords. From there they put out a ton of great records, including A Juvenile Product of the Working Class, Five Lessons Learned, Brazen Head, Swingin’ Utters and Dead Flowers, Bottles, Bluegrass, and Bones. For 10 years the Utters toured relentlessly with the likes of Rancid, NOFX, Dropkick Murphys and everyone in between. Which brings us back to celebrating their 25th anniversary, the band fully recharged with their second album in three years and no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\nWhen the Swingin’ Utters finally released Here, Under Protest last April after an 8 year wait, fans were seriously excited and rewarded for their loyalty and patience with another well-crafted punk rock masterpiece. And that was just the start. With a flurry of writing in 2012, the band quickly released a new two song 7” titled The Librarians Are Hiding Something last Fall, with another full length already recorded, now set for release on February 19th, 2013. Now what was particularly cool about this single is that the A-side was a nice precursor to what fans could expect from the upcoming full length in that it welcomed the appearance of new bassist Miles Peck on an Utters record AND marked Jack Dalrymple’s debut as a songwriter for the band, as he and vocalist Johnny Bonnel co-wrote Librarians. Said Bonnel, “I’ll simply say it is one of the happiest times in my years with Swingin’ Utters. Being able to create music with these dudes is pretty exciting and I’m looking forward to writing more!” And so onwards and upwards to the present.\n\n\nWith their latest opus Poorly Formed, Swingin’ Utters continue to shatter musical boundaries. Obviously they’ve got the punk rock end of the spectrum nailed, and have always had a flare for folk and coun¬try as well, but this album sees them hone their indie/post-punk/garage-rock skills. Part of that is due to the emergence of Jack Dalrymple (of One Man Army fame) as a contributing songwriter for the first time since he officially joined the band and started recording with them on their last full-length. Mix that with Johnny and Darius’ well established songwriting prowess, and round it out with their collective pop sensibilities, and what you end up with is a truly unforgettable album. Picture some classic Swingin’ Utters with a dash of Gang of Four and a pinch of The Strokes, all wrapped up in a bunch of catchy melodies and you’ll start to get an idea of what you’re in for with Poorly Formed. Darius Koski, singer/guitarist had this to say about the record:\n\n\n“Our new record was written pretty quickly, more so than anything we’ve done in the past. One of the reasons, I think, was that Jack had several songs in various stages of completeness, but once he decided to give Johnny the music, and have Johnny write the lyrics and vocal melody to his instrumentation, things started to fly… So there are several of these Johnny/Jack songs on the record (which marks the first songs Jack’s written with us). In that way, it was a brand new writing process for us, so it was pretty exciting, and we’re really happy with the way all of these songs came out in the end. Mixing with Chris Dugan was an added bonus, and we really hope we can work with him again! We’ll be on the west coast in March, as well as a few NoCal record release shows in late February. We’re planning on hitting everywhere else in the US (and Canada too!) by the end of the summer. We’re going to Australia with Frank Turner and the Dropkick Murphys for a few days in early April (our first time on that continent!), and heading to Europe in July. Hopefully Japan sometime in the fall.”\n\n\nGet ready to redefine just who the Swingin’ Utters are, since they’re not a band who’s ever made the same record twice. And while the tones and arrangements set this record apart from their recent work, there’s still plenty of piss ‘n’ vinegar along with all the other hallmarks of a great Swingin’ Utters record: catchy melodies, diverse instrumentation, and intelligent, heartfelt lyrics.\n\n\nswinginutters.com\n\n\nScheisse Minnelli Scheisse Minnelli is a HC Punk band based in Germany. The band was started in late 2003 by two native Californians and two Germans. The current line up takes it back to that original 50/50 brew with 2 germans, Marlon and Dash, holding the rhythm tight being joined by California's two most wanted Samuel el Action on vocals and introducing delinquent Mikey P. on guitar.\n\n\nThey have played over 600 gigs, tour hard internationally, have shared the stage with the likes of Poison Idea, Dr. Know, Murder Junkies, Municipal Waste, Seein’ Red, DI, Christ on Parade, Antiseen, UK Subs, No Use for A Name, Subhumans, TSOL, NOFX, Jello Biafra, Fang, Pennywise, DRI, Scream, Beowulf and Raw Power. Scheisse Minnelli has toured all over Germany, Belgium, Holland, Denmark,England, Switzerland, Romania, Spain, Austria, Italy, France, Czech Rep, Poland, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and have toured the United States three times playing over 60 gigs there, as well as an successful tour through Indonesia in 2014. \n \nThey have released 4 full length albums on LP and CD along with an assortment of splits, comps and 7 inches.

Ghost Bath writes and creates under the assumption that music is an extension of one's own soul.\n\n\nThey journey through the sorrow and sadness that all lives experience, but leave a glimmer of hope. They portray both deep anguish and angelic soundscapes that are sure to leave an impression on the listener. The band started in October of 2013 with the release of their self-titled EP on Solitude Productions (China). This was followed by their debut LP titled, \"Funeral,\" which was released on Pest Productions (China) in June of 2014. \"Moonlover\" was released on Northern Silence Productions(Germany) in 2015. In 2016, the band was signed by Nuclear Blast Records. \n \nA recently found note... \n \n\"He walked the graveyard every night. I watched from my bedroom window. His pitch black cloak fluttered in the wind and the silhouette of his sauntering walk proved hard to catch in the darkness of the graves beneath the trees. It was after a few months of observing that I decided to follow him. He admired the many tombstones and crypts before turning down an abandoned part of town. I tucked my head into the front of my sweater to brave the cold and kept back as to not alert him. \n \nWe arrived at a broken down shack of a home and he walked down a set of wooden stairs. I could hear whispers and screams coming from the basement and, as much as I wanted to turn around right there, I did not falter, continuing into the abyss. A small crowd gathered near what I presumed to be a stage. They chatted quietly under sounds of agony projecting from behind a nearby door. A small amount of candlelight revealed music equipment on stage ready to be played. \n \nBefore long the tortured screams came to an end. The mysterious door opened and group of robed individuals solemnly ambled towards the instruments in a single file line. The crowd shushed itself quickly and all eyes turned. With equipment in hand, most of the candles were blown out leaving an eerie atmosphere. A soft intro was played on the piano in the corner. It was beautiful. \n \nThen something strange happened. As the piano intro ascended into intense chords, complicated scales, and heartfelt melodies, a pure, porcelain bathtub was carried into the room. A few members of the audience set candles around the tub while others filled the bath with clear water. An aroma of lily-of-the-valley filled the room and danced in unison with the passionate sound of piano keys. \n \nSoon, the guitars sprang forth. The beginning chords were loud and startled me. When the full band entered a song all at once my heart almost couldn't take it. Delicate guitars, alluring keys, and an unrelenting drum sound saturated the cellar air. It comforted me more than I ever imagined music could. When the vocalist began his howls of anguish, I knew this was something different. His arms shown vivid crimson gashes that told the story of a lonely and disturbed soul. Contrast of uplifting, almost angelic, music and the vocalist's deep pain created conflict that spoke to me. Not a dry eye existed in the place. The first tune finished with more piano and all I could hope for was more. \n \nA stunningly gorgeous woman strolled onto the stage after a good amount of songs had been played. Her jet black hair nestled on her shoulders. She also wore a robe and released it onto the ground near the bath. Her arms, thighs, and stomach exposed a life lived in depression. Scars marked her otherwise perfect flesh. She gazed upward and stepped into the frigid tub one foot at a time. She lied down and her face sunk in clear liquid. Her auroral jade eyes remained visible in the water. I shot a stare to the others around but not one of them moved. \n \nSwells in the continuing music released all tension. My thoughts propelled into brilliance visions soaring through the clouds above. Before the magnificent bridge came to an end the woman gaped her mouth wide. Her jaw remained in eternal yawn. As water filled her lungs, a smile grew on her pale cheeks. She floated to the top of the bath -lifeless. \n \nSuch conflict of emotions. Such a contrast of distress and euphoria. When the song concluded I quickly regained my senses. I had just witnessed someone taking their own life. My heart raced as a shiver ran down my arms. Before the next song could begin I found myself sprinting up the splintered staircase and through the graveyard -the sleeping fields. Sleep did not come easy. \n \nNo signs of the previous night's events existed upon my return the next morning. I scoured the deserted home without success. But just as I decided to give up my eyes caught a glimpse of two words carved into the bottom wooden stair: \"Ghost Bath.\" - (Nameless)\n\n\nghostbath.bandcamp.com\n\n\nAstronoid is a five-piece band from Boston, MA with influences ranging from Devin Townsend and Mew to Alcest and Cynic.

The driving rhythms, subtle time signatures and soaring vocal harmonies combine to create an auditory cloud to lift you into the ether. There’s always something new to discover hidden within the dense layers of thrashy guitar riffs and euphoric vocals. Lyrically, the record conveys a disillusioned and hopeful view of the world as a whole.\n\n\nastronoidband.com",

Though bestowed with a strong voice both lulling and bracing in its quality, Ashley spent the first five years of her musical career playing bass guitar for rock-noir outfit The Organ before recording and/or touring with Bonnie Prince Billy, Pink Mountaintops and Lightning Dust.\n\n\nsoundcloud.com/ashley-shadow\n\n\nHouses of Heaven\n\n\nsoundcloud.com/housesofheaven",

  "artistSummary": "Time: 9:00pm \n\n Day: Saturday \n\n \n Ages: 21+ Ages \n \n Price: $8\n \n\n\nA sister duo from Oklahoma made up of Kelli Mayo and Peyton Bighorse, formed in 2009 after a jam session at the girls’ Halloween party. After recording their debut album Taking Over the World in their living room. Their sophomore album, Lost Wonderfuls, (produced by Exene Cervenka of X and mixed by Kliph Scurlock of The Flaming Lips) was released in April, 2013. Their third album, Fuzz Steilacoom, released March of 2014 was tracked by Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening at Dub Narcotic Studio.\n\n\nRaised on ‘70s punk and early-‘90s alt-rock, Mayo (age 15) and Bighorse (19) mine inspiration from artists as disparate as Johnny Cash, The Ramones, Nirvana, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Bikini Kill and saturate their own songs with a raw energy reminiscent of their musical heroes. Skating Polly takes a minimalist approach to songwriting, with the two self-taught musicians (Bighorse plays guitar, Mayo plays a guitar/bass hybrid called a basitar, and both girls play drums and piano) crafting super-catchy melodies mainly by “messing around with our instruments and figuring out how to make cool noises,” according to Bighorse. But despite their stripped-down aesthetic, their songs contain a rich emotionalism that’s at turns brutally in-your-face, gut-wrenchingly tender, and irresistibly fun. A critic described their single ‘Alabama Movies’ as “an undeniable piece of work…a knockout punch that pummels your rib cage into shrapnel shards for all its thunderous percussion, palpable tension and Kelli Mayo’s piercing, possessed vocals.”\n\n\nAlong with earning the adoration of Cervenka (whom they befriended after attending one of the X singer’s 2010 solo shows and playing their demos on a cell phone), Skating Polly has found fans and supporters in Rosanne Cash, Kat Bjelland and Lori Barbero (Babes in Toyland), Sean Lennon, Donita Sparks (L7), Kate Nash, John Doe (X), legendary DJ Rodney Bingenheimer and the actor Viggo Mortensen. They have shared the stage with punk legends like Mike Watt, and hit the road with indie heavy-hitters Deerhoof, Kate Nash, Flaming Lips and Band of Horses. The stepsisters typically optimize their travel time by writing songs on their ukulele.\n\n\nProlific songwriters who are constantly recording when not on the road, the duo is finalizing two new releases for 2015. In the meantime, they are hitting the road with Perfect Pussy in March. In May, they will play overseas for the first time when they tour the UK with the reunited Babes in Toyland.\n\n\nBoth Mayo and Bighorse are intent on ignoring what’s fashionable and staying true to their passion for challenging music with long-lasting appeal. “The musicians we’re most inspired by are the ones who keep on going and going, who devote their entire lives to coming up with new and different stuff,” says Mayo. “A lot of times at our shows people will come up to us and tell us, ‘Keep on doing what you’re doing, don’t ever stop’ and we’re just like, ‘Yeah—we weren’t planning on ever stopping.”\n\n\nskatingpolly.com",

This transliteration was the starting point for Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux’s unique project, which, by appropriating the punk and post-punk cannon and running it through the Bossa Nova filter, reinvented the cover band genre, revealing new and brilliant talents along the way: Camille, Phoebe Killdeer (whose Fade Out Lines was remixed by The Avener,) Élodie Frégé, Mélanie Pain, Liset Alea...The time seems right to write a new chapter in the Nouvelle Vague saga: with a new album “I Could Be Happy”. Athol Brose is the first EP of the band since 2010 and its coterie of female vocalists. Nouvelle Vague and Friends is thus more of a nexus of forthcoming projects: a new album comprised of punk and post punk standards imbued with the inimitable Nouvelle Vague touch and for the first time original songs written by Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux that will create the surprise by demonstrating that the two producers are not as genius arrangers.",

Adrianne's voice and guitar playing speak of rich emotional territory with grace and insight. In her words, the record tracks \"the masterpiece of existence, which is always folding into itself, people attempting to connect, to both shake themselves awake and to shake off the numbness of certain points in their life. The interpretations might be impressionistic or surrealistic, but they're grounded in simple things.\n\nAdrianne met her longtime musical partner, guitarist and singer, Buck Meek, in Brooklyn a few years ago, and they quickly formed a creative bond tempered by the experience of traveling and performing for months on end in old dive bars, yards, barns, and basements together. They recorded a pair of duo albums (A-Sides and B-Sides), and Adrianne showcased her songs on a solo album, Hours Were The Birds.\n\nNow, as a full rock and roll band, with Buck on guitar, Max Oleartchik on bass, and James Krivchenia on drums, they bring a steady wildness, giving the songs an even deeper layer of nostalgia. \n\n\"The songs of Adrianne Lenker and guitarist Buck Meek are tender and poetic, with punch, philosophical, thoughtful and singable.\" --NPR Music",

His debut EP Change of Scenery was released in May, garnering wide acclaim and millions of online streams. His first label release \"Stung\" came out on Atlantic Records / Taste & Tone in early October, and quickly went to #1 on HypeMachine's popular charts. Shortly after in January 2016 his collaboration with ayokay ,\"Kings of Summer\", soared to #1 on the Spotify Global Viral Chart.

  "artistSummary": "Chastity Belt is a rock band consisting of four friends - guitarists Julia Shapiro and Lydia Lund, bassist Annie Truscott, and drummer Gretchen Grimm. They met in a tiny college town in Eastern Washington, but their story begins for real in Seattle, that celebrated home of Macklemore and the Twelfth Man. Following a post-grad summer apart, a handful of shows and enthusiastic responses from the city's DIY community led them, as it has countless others, into a cramped practice space. They emerged with a debut album, No Regerts, sold it out faster than anyone involved thought possible, and toured America, a country that embraced them with open-ish arms. Now they're back and the tab is settled, the lights are out, the birds are making noise even though the sun isn't really up yet: it's Time to Go Home, their second long-player and first for Hardly Art.\n\nIn the outside world, they realized something crucial: they didn't have to play party songs now that their audience didn't consist exclusively of inebriated 18-22 year olds, as it did in that college town. Though still built on a foundation of post-post-punk energy, jagged rhythms, and instrumental moves that couldn't be anyone else's, the songs they grew into in the months that followed are equal parts street-level takedown and gray-skied melancholy. They embody the sensation of being caught in the center of a moment while floating directly above it; Shapiro's world spins around her on \"On The Floor,\" grounded by Grimm and Truscott's most commanding playing committed to tape. They pay tribute to writer Sheila Heti on \"Drone\" and John Carpenter with \"The Thing,\" and deliver a parallel-universe stoner anthem influenced by Electrelane with \"Joke.\"\n\nRecorded by José Díaz Rohena at the Unknown, a deconsecrated church and former sail factory in Anacortes, and mixed with a cathedral's worth of reverb by Matthew Simms (guitarist for legendary British post-punks and one-time tourmates Wire), Time to Go Home sees Chastity Belt take the nights out and bad parties of their past to their stretching points, watch the world around them break apart in anticipatory haze, and rebuild it in their own image with stunning clarity before anyone gets hungover.",

Since 2014's 'Blue Break EP' he has been locked away harnessing the sound that has taken this classically trained vocalist and pianist into the hazy no-mans-land between jazz, R&B, soul, hip hop and electronica. 'Couch Baby' is the stunning summation of the young talent's journey so far.\n\nAs a self-sufficient producer and composer he describes his own music as \"brooding, cinematic and minimalist.\" This soundscape, which sways from ambient melody to head bopping grooves has already won him many fans in high places like Zane Lowe, Pitchfork and Huw Stephens. The debut record, with its ear worm crooning, and emotive depth and palette, sounds as natural next to the trippy jazz of Kendrick Lamar and Thundercat as it does the spacious atmospherics of The xx.\n\nThree years in the making, 'Couch Baby' has been a \"calming outlet\" for Jamie. It's the latest in a string of releases from him and his friends in the SE LDN crew that have collectively defined the areas new sonic trademarks, \"Other artists say they're from south London, but they haven't got the south London sound. There's a certain feeling that you have to get with it, it's a certain mellowness.\"",

Most recently Lahey has set the music industry abuzz with the insanely catchy You Don’t Think You Like People Like Me. From the attention-grabbing opening bars (those drums sound like an angry landlord thumping your front door on a Sunday morning), it flips the classic break-up line “it’s not you, it’s me” on its head. Upon release in March, People… was immediately added to rotation on triple j, triple j unearthed, Syn FM and FBi FM, and started popping up on music blogs everywhere. It was then Pitchfork gave it Best New Track and got the rest of the world talking. A founding member of avant poppers Animaux, multi-instrumentalist Lahey has now gone solo and pared down her sound, embracing a simple, home-spun story-telling style that’s often underlined by her second love, the fuzz pedal.",

On tracks like \"11 Blocks\" and \"Gimme Your Love,\" the drums may get huge, but the feelings are deeply personal. This is pop music rooted in the singer-songwriter tradition, and it all starts with Wrabel sitting at a piano, fighting for self-expression and survival.\n\nWrabel was born 27 years ago on Long Island. His father was a salesman, and by the time he was in high school he had lived all over the country, even as far as Australia. Over and over he was the new kid in school. \n\nBy 16, he was in high school in Houston and had begun playing piano. A summer program at the Berklee College of Music in Boston led to his enrollment at the college. While at Berklee, Wrabel posted original songs on MySpace, so when a songwriter in England invited him to come over for a writing session, he knew he wasn't long for school. \n\nBefore the end of his first semester, Wrabel left school and headed to Los Angeles. The song \"Ten Feet Tall\" came out of the flush of his relationship with his first serious love, and helped land him a deal with Island records.\n\nHe released his own recording of the song, and sang on Afrojack's version. An EP followed, but after a long period of creative searching Wrabel hadn't found what he was looking for, and he and the label parted ways. He found himself back in Los Angeles, wondering if it was time to pursue a career as a songwriter rather than an artist.",

  "artistSummary": "Drink in hand, his bowtie hanging, the Western Australian-born Cameron Avery has arrived as a new breed of nocturnal crooner, a train-wreck romantic creating timeless, ambitious music for the modern age. \n\n \n\nUtilizing his soulful wit, shrewd arrangements, and a deep, husky baritone, Avery harnesses the dark power and humor of artists like Nick Cave, Scott Walker, and Tindersticks to expertly walk the fine line between vulnerable and venerable.\n\n \n\nHailing from the late 2000’s-era Perth and a healthy scene of hard-hitting garage rock bands, including a long stint as the drummer of Pond, Avery found his musical footing while playing with friends but sought the reward of his own outfit. Encouraged by his friend Kevin Parker of Tame Impala to record on his own, Avery started The Growl as his solo project in 2007, making an EP and an album of aggressive, distorted psychedelic rock and roll. When Parker asked him to join Tame Impala as its touring bassist in 2013, Avery jumped at the chance and rose with that band to the top of the psych-rock heap, but all the while remained focused on carving out his singular identity as an artist and following his own muse.\n\nWhen a longer break for Tame Impala arrived, Avery decided to head to the US to continue work on his album. Melancholic machismo is written into the very DNA of Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams. From the classical, finger-picked guitar on the opener “A Time and Place” and the orchestral vamping of “Do You Know Me By Heart?” to the bombastic, self-assured swagger of “Dance with Me.” He takes an emotive page from the Leonard Cohen songbook-of-longing on “Big Town Girl” just as naturally as he thumbs an aggressive note of Bad Seed strut and Cramps rut on “Watch Me Take It Away.” And by the time he purrs that earnest refrain of “Baby, it’s you” on the album’s closer “C’est Toi,” Avery has surely mastered that drunken tightrope dance.",

The Alabama native has immersed herself in music since her teenage years, forming notable bands such as P.S. Eliot and Bad Banana (both with her twin sister Katie of Waxahatchee). In 2012, she co-founded Swearin’—the band in which she would truly begin to formulate and understand her full potential as a songwriter—and in 2014, she recorded and released her first solo EP Lean In To It. Her debut album is an accomplished work that integrates her past musical experiences with a pronounced growth in arrangement and instrumentation.\n\n“Tourist in This Town is completely made up of heightened anxiety and became a clearly defined puzzle that I slowly put together over the course of a year,” says Crutchfield. “It’s a record about change—change of scenery, of partner, of band, of home, of friends, of outlook—and how that change can cause a temporary panic but ultimate triumph in most of us.”",

The addition of Ethan Goodpaster on lead guitar, Charlie Holt on bass, and Jess Haney on drums brought the group full circle. \n\nAfter riveting performances at CMJ and Savannah Stopover, their fan base has grown from the small college town of Boone to all over the world. In 2015, their hit “Devil Like Me”, was included on Spotify’s Viral 50 Chart peaking at #16 in the U.S. and #6 in Canada. Building on the success of releases Seven + Mary [2013] and RKS [2015], the group closed out 2016 with a streak of 14 sold out U.S. shows from Athens, GA to Boston, MA. \n\nRainbow Kitten Surprise will be touring extensively and working on new music in 2017.",

  "artistSummary": "POTTY MOUTH\nPotty Mouth are Western MA-based trio Abby Weems (guitar, lead vocals), Ally Einbinder (bass) and Victoria Mandanas (drums). Originating in 2011 from the hometown of guitar rock predecessors Dinosaur Jr., Potty Mouth emerged from a casual, \"why not?\" attitude when Einbinder, who met Mandanas at Smith college, set out to form a band with like-minded women who shared her interest in learning and growing together as musicians. Though no singer was chosen at the time of formation, Weems emerged as having a knack for melodies and lyric writing, and what started out as a casual pastime turned into a way of life; recording, making t-shirts, and planning tours soon came in natural succession. \n\nOne year after their formation, the band recorded a 12\" vinyl EP, entitled 'Sun Damage,' released through three small, independently-run labels. 'Sun Damage' garnered the attention of Pitchfork, who called the six-song EP an \"an impressive, no-filler debut,\" as well as local big-hitters The Boston Globe, who named Potty Mouth one of the top five indie-rock bands to watch in 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Potty Mouth signed with Brooklyn-based indie label Old Flame Records to release their debut full-length album, 'Hell Bent.' NPR music premiered the album, calling it \"one of the best rock albums of the year.\" As Potty Mouth garnered national attention, the band began to tour more extensively, co-headlining their first full US tour with Perfect Pussy and Swearin' in summer 2014, as well as supporting artists like Waxahatchee and Juliana Hatfield. \n\nOn August 21, 2015, the band debuted a five-song self-titled EP under their own imprint, Planet Whatever Records. Produced by John Goodmanson (Sleater-Kinney, Blonde Redhead, Bikini Kill) at London Bridge Studios in Seattle, the new EP shows off a new level of both songwriting and production for the trio. Refreshingly candid, singer-guitarist Abby Weems weaves sarcasm and melancholia into a passionate performance held together by drummer Victoria Mandanas and bassist Ally Einbinder's solid foundation. The crisper direction emphasizes the work the triad has put in since 2013's 'Hell Bent,' with more vocal harmonies and bigger production, recalling the sounds of influences like Veruca Salt and Nirvana.",

She traveled up and down the West Coast, busking and playing any bars or cafés that would have her. Soon after, she took a Greyhound bus four nights straight from Phoenix to New York to do the same on the East Coast. For a decade or so since, Courtney’s been a session and backup singer and guitarist for nearly 40 artists, from Jimmy Eat World to Damien Jurado. She never stopped writing her own material, though. Picking up admirers like Jurado and Ryan Adams along the way, she has quietly earned a reputation as a songwriter’s songwriter.\n\nWith plans to settle down for a bit and focus on her own songs, Courtney moved to the Northwest in 2011 to record her last full-length record On My Page. However, the record had hardly been released before she was on the road again performing other artists’ songs, eventually leading her overseas to play guitar and sing with Belgian star Milow. At the tour’s end, though, the other session players joined her to record her 2014 EP Leuven Letters in one take.\n\nIt was during this time that Courtney also wrote many of the songs on Honest Life. She found herself realizing the impact of growing up on the road and this constant reconciling between her and other’s art and identity.",

  "artistSummary": "In 2014, The Wind and The Wave, a duo from Austin, TX, quietly released one of the best albums of the year. From The Wreckage glowed with a rootsy golden tone that encompassed everything from indie-folk, to alt-country to blues-rock to Southern psychedelia. Its creators, touring musician turned songwriter and producer Dwight Baker and singer-songwriter Patty Lynn, began making music together on a lark, never dreaming anything would come of it. Baker describes it as “kind of like what happens when two friends hold hands and jump in a freezing lake just to see what it feels like.” Thanks to the undeniable chemistry between the pair, the music took on a life of its own and The Wind and The Wave soon found themselves with a major-label record deal, embarking on U.S. headlining tours supporting From The Wreckage, having their songs appear in such TV shows as Grey’s Anatomy, and racking up millions of plays on Spotify and Apple Music. The band also earned itself a rabid following, with fans especially enamored of Lynn’s feisty vocals and brutally personal lyrics about challenging relationships with lovers and family members as well as her relationship with herself.\n\nSo when it came time for The Wind and The Wave to make their second album, Baker says he and Lynn felt “some bit of an obligation to deliver that again.” The band definitely deliver on their new album, Happiness Is Not A Place, and the result is the sound of a band that has stretched itself and grown. Lynn manages to dig even deeper with her lyrics, exploring her feelings about marriage, commitment, and family, while acknowledging her own frantic mind. And the band’s sonic palette is nervier, thanks to the album being recorded live by producer Butch Walker, a songwriter and musician who’s produced records for such artists as Weezer and Panic! At The Disco.",

  "artistSummary": "POWERS\nIntimate can be loud. Rambunctious can be endearing. Heartfelt can be lighthearted. POWERS introduced themselves to the world on that premise. And it listened. Their recent romping bursting, single, \"Beat of My Drum\" shot up to the top of the Hype Machine popular page instantaneously after its summer release, and found itself on top of Spotify's viral charts and iTunes Emerging Artists spotlight. Following up with an equally impactful, \"Loved by You\", the 2 most recent releases have garnered nearly 5 million plays in just two months. The band's first track last fall was featured globally on ad campaigns for J. Crew & Mastercard. Indie Shuffle has called them \"Infectious and damn right catchy\", and Stereofox encouraged us to look up indie-pop in the dictionary (they said we'd find the song there - we did). \n\nPOWERS is Mike Del Rio and Crista Ru. If you haven't heard their names, rest assured, you've heard their tunes. After Mike Del Rio inked a publishing deal with Alex Da Kid (Rihanna's \"I Love the Way You Lie\", Imagine Dragons), his writing and productions started popping up on TVs, playlists and radios everywhere. After working with top pop artists such as Selena Gomez, Kylie Minogue, & Cee Lo Green, Mike most recently made waves by producing the anthemic X Ambassadors ft Jamie N Commons & Jay Z \"Jungle\" and executive producing The Knocks \"So Classic\" EP (of which POWERS wrote and featured on the title track \"Classic\"). On the flip side of this creative powerhouse is writer Crista Ru. Aside from lending her breathy vocals and exquisite toplining to POWERS, her credits read like a who's who of the recent pop landscape. From penning the lead tune from Selena Gomez's most recent release to working with Swedish pop duo Icona Pop, Ms. Ru has a poignant knack as an artistic muse and a searing-hot songstress, stirring the two together to create electrifying performances.\n\nWith a versatile background in crafting both sonic and melodic textures, it's clear that this LA duo is poised to continue their blossoming ascent as these two tunesmiths are doing classic popular songwriting with a biting and prescient sense of modernity. With POWERS, one listen will loop your ears and your heart. And in 2015, that's a rarity that you're going to want to hit repeat on over and over again.",

The self titled album rode the Billboard Magazine Top 100 list for 10 weeks.\n\nThe second full length album was released in 1969, titled CONTACT. A national tour was launched by the band's recording popularity. A third album was recorded in 1970, but not released when KAPP folded. Without a record label the band disbanded, and, except for an occasional bootleg release, was not heard from again until 1994, when a German label named TRC, without license, re-released the first two albums in a double CD version, complete with poster. Since then numerous artists around the world have released covers, tributes and samplings of Silver Apples material.\n\nIn 1996, Simeon re-activated Silver Apples, recording and performing with many musician friends and admirers. On March 10, 2005, original drummer, Danny Taylor, passed away of a heart attack in Kingston, New York. He was 56 years old. Working as a solo performer, with Danny's drum sounds recreated by electronic means, Simeon has continued the Silver Apples live concerts with performances literally all over the world. Currently Simeon is still recording and performing as a solo.",

  "artistSummary": "RADIOHEAD are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of the band's debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's style, as they incorporated influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Despite initially dividing fans and critics, Kid A was later named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was the band's final album for their record label, EMI; their subsequent releases have been self-released. Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. Their ninth album is expected in 2016. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

  "artistSummary": "RADIOHEAD are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of the band's debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's style, as they incorporated influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Despite initially dividing fans and critics, Kid A was later named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was the band's final album for their record label, EMI; their subsequent releases have been self-released. Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. Their ninth album is expected in 2016. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

The tour announces on the heels of Legend’s fifth studio album Darkness and Light, which has received a plethora of critical praise since its December 2nd release on Columbia Records. USA Today hailed the album as John’s “most personal record” with tracks like “Right By You” which they described as “a heart –tugging rumination on his 7-month old daughter, Luna.” Time Magazine called the body of work “unflappably classy” while the New York Times said Legend “treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match.” Continuing, the New York Times pointed to the album’s most recent anthemic hit single, “Love Me Now”, which they praised as “a seize the moment song”, that “revolves around an insistent, lo-fi piano figure, and its chorus first arrives with Mr. Legend nearly alone, singing over simple, fading chords”.\nLegend also continues his successful foray into the world of film as one of the principles for production company Get Lifted Film Co., which has an executive producing credit on the 14-time Oscar-nominated film La La Land in which John also appears, playing a jazz band leader named Keith alongside stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Legend also contributed to the film’s soundtrack with the original song “Start a Fire.” To date, La La Land has taken home an impressive six Golden Globe Awards, two SAG Awards and a PGA Award.",

Nothing could have made 3EB happier! 3EB, however, have experienced no comparable loss. Instead, they have gained artistic clarification — and, surprisingly, a fan base who is larger, younger and more dedicated than ever. Participation in the older, untouchable realm of nervous star-making could color a band’s identity. In the case of 3EB, it often blurred the perception of their brilliant musical creations. In recent years, those creations have recast the band among a current generation of fans. 3EB now write, tour, record, and communicate in a fluid new world where their music continues naturally to evolve. Their exchange with their audience is unfiltered and being from the hub of tech, they are using it to develop a closer exchange with their audience. After a stunning festival run in 2016 with appearances at Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Bumbershoot, Bonnaroo and many others, they are poised for a fantastic 20th Anniversary celebration in 2017 with new material to be released.",

The track premiered today on Rollingstone.com. The highly anticipated new material accompanies the film, The Smog Of The Sea, a documentary that provides a new perspective on the once pristine oceans of the world, while making an artful call to action for rethinking single-use plastic. The Smog Of The Sea is available to stream starting today via, www.smogofthesea.com.\nCurbing the use of single-use plastic has been at the forefront of Johnson’s work for over a decade. Since 2005, Johnson’s crew has implemented a plastic free backstage and since 2007 all shows have offered fans free water through water-refill stations. In 2014, Johnson successfully helped launch a Reusable Pint Program at the Santa Barbara Bowl, which has since inspired venues across the country to follow suit, including the Les Schwab Amphitheatre in Bend, OR, and all venues owned by Live Nation. This summer, more venues will adopt a Reusable Pint Program, which provides fans with an alternative to disposable plastic cups. Fans who purchase this reusable stainless steel cup at venue concessions will receive a discount on all beverage refill purchases for the life of the cup.\nIn addition to these plastic free initiatives, Johnson and his production team, alongside Reverb, will continue to pave the way in green touring practices with extensive sustainability programs at every show. On the 2017 tour, additional greening actions include sourcing sustainable biodiesel for tour vehicles, producing up-cycled and eco-friendly merchandise, and expanding waste reduction, composting and recycling. The tour will also source local, organic food as part of a “farm to stage” program, offer bike valets and alternative transportation incentives, as well as offset all remaining CO2 emissions. Through Johnson’s All At Once campaign, the summer tour will support over 140 non-profit partners and will engage fans to take action in support of sustainable local food systems and plastic free initiatives. Fans can visit these partners in the Village Green and participate in the greening actions at each show and win a chance to watch Johnson’s set from the Best Seats in the House….the stage!

  "artistSummary": "Like the days of Steely Dan, Harry Nilsson or Prince releasing a classic every year (or less) comes ’s Another One, a mini-LP announced almost one year to the date of the meteorically successful Salad Days. Conceived and recorded entirely by himself in a short period between a relentless tour schedule at his new place in Far Rockaway, Queens, Another One is eight, freshly written songs, expanding the arsenal of Mac’s already impressive catalog. There’s a bittersweet, romantic sensibility present. The overall feeling is lost love, or perhaps love never found, yet Mac embraces this without making it an overly somber experience for the listener. It’s at times haunting and warm, and a bit more refined and sophisticated, but still plenty playful, retaining the guts and soul of classic Mac.",

  "artistSummary": "Kacey Chambers\nThere’s a moment in most artists’ young lives when they realise music will shape their future and define who they are.  didn’t have to wait for that moment to arrive. Music is part of her DNA. \nBorn in Mt Gambier in South Australia, Kasey grew up in a home environment where listening to and performing country and roots music was a way of life. It had to rub off _and it did _ just as in later years, living on the Nullarbor Plain and travelling all over Australia with her family, the young Kasey got an education like no other. \nShe spent her childhood absorbing the music of Hank Williams, Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash and other country greats loved by her parents. It was in the family’s revered Dead Ringer Band with dad Bill, mum Di and older brother Nash that 10-year-old Kasey got her first real taste of being on stage. By the time she was in her late teens she was fronting the band and writing some of the songs. \nA change came in 1998 when Kasey, at the age of 22, travelled overseas on a rites-of-passage voyage of discovery. She came back ready to start her solo career. The resultant album, The Captain (1999) remains one of the most extraordinary and lauded debuts by an Australian artist in any genre. Songs such as the title track, ‘Cry Like a Baby’ and ‘These Pines’ boast a maturity beyond her years and a wealth of Americana-styled musical influences, yet the album has Australia and family at its core, ingredients that have been a staple of Kasey’s song-writing ever since then.",

  "artistSummary": "As an expression of cultural joy, you can’t top an Irish wake. And what is a wake but a celebration-a toast of appreciation-an expression of love-and a damn good party?\n\nSo when seven top Bay Area musicians realized they shared as deep a love for the songs of the Grateful Dead as they did for traditional Celtic tunes, some brand-new music sprang up and started partying. \nWAKE THE DEAD is a romp that flows seamlessly from rock grooves to hot Irish reels, and from haunting airs to achingly beautiful melodies familiar to Deadheads everywhere. “Sugaree” in waltz time, bracketed by an ancient harp tune and infused with a poignant Celtic longing. “Bertha” thundering out of “China Cat” on a mandolin tidal wave. The eerie lilt of the uilleann pipes, giving a glow to “Bird Song” as if it was always meant to be there. Groove jams to keep the tie-dye swirling. Vocal harmonies that float like clouds. The music takes off, and the band follows, grinning all the way. These aren’t worlds colliding-they’re worlds meshing, coalescing­ creating a whole new world of possibility, and true to the spirits of the Grateful Dead and the eternally hopeful Celts. \nWAKE THE DEAD bands together seven of the best-known and most respected players in the west. Harper Maureen Brennan has toured for over 30 years and recorded the acclaimed “Harpistry” collection. Bassist Cindy Browne is equally at home in folk and jazz, touring globally as the musical fusion go-to gal. Singer, fiddler, and octave mandolinist Danny Carnahan is an award-winning songwriter whose original Irish-tinged songs are popular worldwide. Kevin Carr is a musical triple-threat, renowned as a dance fiddler, a pennywhistler, and Irish piper par excellence. Sylvia Herold’s delicious vocal phrasing can also be heard on her solo recordings and her performances with Euphonia. Paul Kotapish is known far and wide for his work with Kevin Burke’s Open House, and for his blazing guitar and mandolin with The Hillbillies From Mars and Euphonia. And Latin percussionist Brian Rice rounds out the band’s groove engine.",

Portland Metronome puts the quintet “at the forefront of a youthful generation trying to redefine what string music is and what it can do.”\n\nThat progressive nature shines through in the band’s latest album, Washoe (February 26). A 12-song collection of original songs by Dead Winter Carpenter members, Washoe’s diverse track list pays tribute to diverse musical influences including classic rock, bluegrass, alt-country, and rockabilly. Highlight tracks include “Midnight Ghost,” “Love Amongst Thieves,” and “Winning Hand,” and the angst-tinged duet, “If I Wrote You A Song.” \nThe five-piece outfit is:\n\n-fiddler/vocalist – Jenni Charles\n\n-upright bassist/vocalist – Dave Lockhart\n\n-guitarist/vocalist – Jesse Dunn\n\n-guitarist/vocalist – Bryan Daines\n\n-drummer/vocalist – Brian Huston \nThe Last Revel\nFrom the budding music scene of the Upper Midwest comes the cutting edge Front Porch Americana soundscapes of The Last Revel. This powerfully talented trio of multi-instrumentalists from Minneapolis, Minnesota so naturally blends the genres of Folk, Rockabilly, Old Time String-Band and Rock to create a sound that is as equally original as it is timeless. \nThe Last Revel trio utilizes their multi-instrumental abilities to bring the acoustic guitar, upright bass, fiddle, 5-string banjo, harmonica, kick drum and three-part vocal harmonies together to consistently deliver “Bombastic live performances,” as well as delicate and haunting folk ballads. \nWith their second, self titled, album released in May of 2015, The Last Revel further demonstrates their ability to create rich and delicately textured recorded material with a modern “tip of the hat” to the storied history of American folk music.",

Adrian's signature tones, unique use of effects and whammy bar remains completely different, and his techniques continue to be a huge influence on today's guitarists. He was guitarist, songwriter and frontman Progressive Rock Powerhouse King Crimson for over 30 years. \"Discipline\", Adrian's first record with King Crimson, is listed among the most important rock records ever made.\n\nBelew has had a career that commands both awe and respect from fellow musicians and loyal fans, from his first solo record \"The Lone Rhino\" to The Atlantic Records hit album \"Mr. Music Head\" or any of his other 20 solo records that push sonic boundaries while maintaining artistic integrity. Adrian shreds on guitar but also writes beautiful songs that will make you cry. Yes, Adrian has taken his fans on a wild ride through countless world tours and albums with David Bowie, Talking Heads, Laurie Anderson, NIN and Paul Simon. He truly is the Twang Bar King!\n\nMeanwhile, Belew continues work on the latest additions to his FLUX project, including an album called FLUXbybelew and an in-app addition entitled FLUXation. FLUX is 'music which is never the same twice'. To accommodate the original concept FLUX was released on iTunes as a music app for iPhone and iPad (the only one of its kind, available on iTunes at bit.ly/FLUX_cd) with the app downloaded, you press Play to activate 30 minutes of music, songs, sounds, and visuals which will never happen again in quite the same way. that's because of some very clever algorithms and a huge amount of content.",

  "artistSummary": "Jackie Greene\n\"We live in such a fast-paced, hectic environment, I wanted to make a record that would invite people to step back and take their time to listen,\" Jackie Greene says of Back to Birth, his first album in five years. \"I wanted to make a record that would reward people who are willing to sit down and give it a couple of serious listens.\"\n\nBack to Birth - Greene's seventh album and his Yep Roc Records debut - is more than worthy of some serious attention. The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me. We know each other well enough at this point that we can be blunt with each other, and he'll tell me that I'm full of it if that's what I need to hear.\"\n\nThe musical passion and creative integrity that drive Back to Birth have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. While growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Hot on the heels of the 2015 album release The Outsider, the full-length documentary Island Bound, and an extensive tour schedule, Isle of Man-born Davy Knowles announces his new album Three Miles From Avalon. This collection of new songs sees Davy returning to his roots, and the sounds that first ignited his passion for music.\n\nRecorded exclusively in his adopted hometown of Chicago, the capital of electric blues provided Knowles with a landscape steeped in legend, inspiring him to creatively explore the genre of music he's always loved – energetic, guitar driven blues-rock.\n\nKnowles began the recording process for Three Miles From Avalon with a fresh approach, one that has resulted in a dynamic, gutsy sound: \"I wanted to go back to the basics. The band and myself have racked up a lot of playing time together, and we have really started to gel. I wanted to capture that 'live' feel in the studio\n\nThis led naturally to a back-to-basics approach, and a search for authenticity when it came to recording the new material: \"My favourite sounding records are certainly older ones, recorded to tape, with minimal fuss or overdubs. I wanted that lovely warm, vintage sound that only tape and glowing tubes can do.\"\n\nA raw, vintage sound is evident in the album's opening two tracks, the hard-driving Ain't Much Of Nothing, and a long-time live favourite, What You're Made Of, a homage to one of Davy's musical heroes: \"Rory Gallagher has been a huge influence for me, his energy and drive was so mesmerising. I wanted to get back to that high energy, big guitar riff style of writing.\"\n\nFalling Apart, the album's third track, adds dark drama to the record's driving pace with its smoky verses and heavy, snarling, blues riff. \"I've had this song kicking around for a long time, but it wasn't until I had found this guitar pedal called 'The Octron' (one of only two pedals used by Knowles on the entire album) that the song and the riff really came to life, it's got this wonderful menacing sound.\"\n\nWeaving a moment of pathos into the tracklist is Oxford MS – a fictional account of shady dealing and violence. Storytelling has always been a vital ingredient in Knowles' work: \"Songs with characters and stories have always grabbed me, and I wanted to write one in the blues and gospel vein, it's a story of blackmail, gambling and regret, though certainly not an autobiographical one!\"\n\nYet it's the title track, Three Miles From Avalon, which brings to the fore very personal aspects to a tale. \"The song is really all about being slightly further away than where you want to be, and the frustration that comes with that. Avalon is this Arthurian legend, the Island that could never be found. It became my metaphor for things just out of my grasp.\"\n\nThe song also reveals the musical influences close to Davy's heart, showcasing his love of blues and classic rock with affection\n\nThe album closes on a hat tip to one of the all-time greats, Willie Dixon, with a re-working of his blues classic What In The World. Performed with a live, 'after hours' feel, the track showcases Knowles' confident and distinctive guitar playing, but also a powerful solo on the Hammond B3 by Andrew Toombs – demonstrating that Knowles and his tight-knit band all possess not only stunning technical ability, but soul too.",

  "artistSummary": "Jackie Greene\n\"We live in such a fast-paced, hectic environment, I wanted to make a record that would invite people to step back and take their time to listen,\" Jackie Greene says of Back to Birth, his first album in five years. \"I wanted to make a record that would reward people who are willing to sit down and give it a couple of serious listens.\"\n\nBack to Birth - Greene's seventh album and his Yep Roc Records debut - is more than worthy of some serious attention. The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me. We know each other well enough at this point that we can be blunt with each other, and he'll tell me that I'm full of it if that's what I need to hear.\"\n\nThe musical passion and creative integrity that drive Back to Birth have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. While growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Jerry Joseph\nFor more than 30 years, Jerry Joseph has been strapping on a guitar and chasing down truth, understanding and soul with a tenacity and resonant skill that mark him as a hard charging kindred spirit to Joe Strummer, Warren Zevon and Patti Smith. While not a household name or critic's darling, Joseph is the archetypal musician's musician, something resoundingly clear in his live performances, as well as his studio work. \n\nJoseph's current foursome, the Jackmormons, is the latest chapter in his long, strange musical journey that flows like glowing quicksilver through the modern psyche, where war and disaster wrestle with hope and faith. The Jackmormons currently feature Joseph (guitar, lead vocals), Steve Drizos (drums, backing vocals), Steve James Wright (bass, backing vocals) and Jeff Crosby (guitar, vocals). \n\nJoseph first came to prominence in the mid-1980s with still-beloved cult band Little Women, a reggae-rock proto-jam band that dominated the Rocky Mountain club scene for nearly a decade, and notably helped break jam giants Widespread Panic, who looked up to Joseph and opened for his band before rising to prominence. In fact, Joseph wrote many of Panic's favorite concert staples, including such blazing epics as North, Chainsaw City and Climb to Safety. \n\nSteve Drizos and Steve James Wright are also musical lifers working steadily for decades both as sparring partners to Jerry Joseph and elsewhere. Drizos was a member of acoustic Dexter Grove from 1995-2004, a band that performed over 1,500 shows nationally. Drizos produced the live Jackmormons record Badlandia and co-produced Happy Book, as well as performing and recording with such luminaries as Dave Mason and Jim Capaldi (of Traffic), Widespread Panic, The Decemberists, moe., Merle Saunders, Eric McFadden, and dozens of local Portland artists. \n\nSteve James Wright has been a complement to Joseph since almost Day One, as the guitarist for Little Women and an outstanding player in his own right. After taking some time off, James graciously and expertly moved over to bass to bring back a slinkier, funkier and more psychedelic mood to the Jackmormons sound. His deep knowledge of the material and his more melodic style now combine to challenge the band to find its finest grooves.\n\nThe more recent addition of young stud guitar player/singer/songwriter Jeff Crosby (Jeff Crosby & The Refugees) has proved another prescient move by Joseph. A couple of Crosby’s songs from the 2013 album, Silent Conversations, were featured on the hit FX series, Sons of Anarchy. Crosby helps brings out the Americana sensibility of the Jackmormons sound, and his crisp guitar work proves an admirable counterpart to Joseph’s open-minded approach. And a Crosby tune or 2 has become a welcome part of a Jackmormons’ set.\n\nJoseph’s influences are many and varied. “Columbia Record Club used to have 20 records for a penny and I filled out form after form, and these boxes of records came to my house and my parents would flip out. Those were my influences,” says Joseph. “I was a kid, so I was as into The Monkees as I was The Beatles. Then, my mother would tell you, it was all over on my 9th or 10th birthday with [Black Sabbath's] Master of Reality and Steppenwolf Live. Then at 12, it was jazz. I saw every jazz act that toured in the 70s…Herbie Hancock and Tower of Power after we went to see Steely Dan. All that and then my older babysitter bought me Exile on Main Street and I saw [Bob Marley and] The Wailers in 1976 and moved to New Zealand. And then The Clash came out and changed my life. But I also loved ZZ Top and all those guitar bands. When I lived in New Zealand, I sat in my window and read Lord of the Rings while listening to prog like Gentle Giant and Camel. Later, I learned a lot from Chris Whitley touring around Europe with him.”\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph is steadily extending his global reach, taking advantage of the Internet's ability to find audiences worldwide with tours in Southeast Asia, Europe, Central America, Israel, Lebanon, Ireland, England and elsewhere. Joseph is a hyper-gifted American singer-songwriter finding appreciation beyond his own country's borders, an endlessly insightful rabble-rouser and back street shaman. His creative tendrils extend beyond the Jackmormons into everything from extensive solo work to rangy rock juggernaut Stockholm Syndrome (where Joseph plays with Widespread Panic's Dave Schools, Bay Area guitar marvel Eric McFadden, Gov't Mule's Danny Louis, and percussionist Wally Ingram), and a host of unreleased work.\n\nDespite the sort of roadblocks and turns of fortune that usually crush most musicians, Joseph survives, and in fact, thrives in a way that's heartening and stirring, as anyone who has seen a live show can testify.\n\n“I'm lucky. I work. I've never had to play in a cover band. I've never had to wear a funny hat, “ says Joseph. “Perhaps because of the lack of traditional success, I've put out about a record a year, plus all the stuff that's never come out, and it's kept me creatively honest. I don't rehash my past. I don't repeat any of my old hits because I don't have any big hits.”",

  "artistSummary": "Since moving to Los Angeles from her native Guatemala, singer-songwriter Gaby Moreno has achieved remarkable success as a musician. She has been nominated for an Emmy and won a Latin Grammy for Best New Artist. She has released four albums, toured with singers Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco, Punch Brothers, Hugh Laurie and Calexico, and has shared the international stage with pop music luminaries such as Bono, Andrea Boccelli and Van Dyke Parks.\n\nIn 2006, her song, “Escondidos,” took the top prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, the first contestant in the Latin category to win Song of the Year. (She’s now a judge.) That opened many more doors. Her first album, “Still the Unknown” , produced independently was released in 2008.\n\nMoreno’s career started moving quickly. She co-wrote the theme song of the television series “Parks and Recreation,” which was nominated for an Emmy in 2010. That same year, she recorded the classic song “Smile,” by Charlie Chaplin, for the Oscar-winning documentary “The Cove.” And she performed “Toast to Freedom,” a song commemorating the 50th anniversary of Amnesty International, first with Kris Kristofferson on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, then in Dublin where she shared the stage with Angelique Kidjo and Bono.\n\nShe released her second album, “Illustrated Songs” in 2011, followed by “Postales.” in 2012, her first release entirely in Spanish and with Metamorfosis, the label founded by her compatriot Ricardo Arjona, one of Latin America’s most prominent singer-songwriters. . That year, Moreno and Arjona released a duet, “Fuiste Tu,” which was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year in the 13th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nBy the time Moreno was named Best New Artist in the 14th annual Latin Grammy Awards of 2013, the “newcomer” had already almost spent half her life in the music business.\n\nWhen it came time to record her latest album, “Ilusión” (due for release September 9th), Moreno decided it was time to harken back to beginnings. Musically, the new album captures the pure spirit of the aspiring immigrant artist who made her way in a new country with just her guitar, her gifted voice, and a pocketful of songs she was eager to share.\n\n“I wanted the record to sound as authentic and as close as possible to what the band sounds live,” she says, referring to her longtime collaborators. “I said, ‘Okay, let’s go back to the sound when I put out my first album, when it was just a few musicians in a room together, and it was about having fun and capturing performances. I wanted something human. I’m not a robot. I wanted to embrace the imperfections. That’s human. Maybe in the moment, I’m feeling something that’s making my voice break. It’s raw emotion. I wanted to keep that.\"\n\nAnd she succeeded. The new collection of 13 songs, most of which she wrote or co-wrote, reflect the organic mixture of her wide array of influences, from the blues to boleros. The record’s natural sound reflects the analog philosophy of producer Gabe Roth, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Daptone Records, the independent label specializing in what it calls the “New Sound of Old Soul.”\n\nThat’s a slogan that happens to suit the singer to a tee. \n\n“I don’t want to sound like an old record, but there’s something about those old records that I love, especially that warm sound,” says Moreno. “This is why I wanted to go into the studio for this new record with Gabe Roth. Because of his minimalist approach. He doesn’t use any computers, it’s all his ears. We did it all to tape, using these beautiful old vintage microphones, and playing all together in the same room. So you don’t have the luxury of doing 20 takes for every song. We do three takes and choose the best one out of the three. It was kind of nerve-racking... but it sounds so real.”\n\nThe album includes separate Spanish and English versions of the first single, “Se Apagó/Love Is Gone,” a song of heartbreak with a twangy guitar, a bright brass section and a feel of Southern soul. Nashville-based R&B singer Jonny P joins her on their English duet, a couple’s dialog.\n\nMoreno’s uplifting, hymn-like “Fronteras,” which means borders, reveals a theme of hope in the midst of darkness. In a time of persecution of immigrants, the song extends a hand of camaraderie for those who leave everything behind to pursue their dreams. The bilingual refrain captures the essence of “Ilusión” and the composer’s confident, mature state of mind when she created it: “And I laugh and dance. It’s in my blood. And I dream free. This is where I belong.”",

  "artistSummary": "Gaelynn Lea All the Roads that Lead Us Home & The Songs We Sing Along the Way\n\nGaelynn Lea is a musician from Duluth, MN. She has been playing violin for over twenty years. First classically trained, she began learning traditional Celtic and American fiddle tunes at the age of 18. During her college years Gaelynn started sitting in with various folk/rock musicians and developed an improvisational style all her own. Eventually she also began singing and dabbling in songwriting. Gaelynn has played alongside many notable Minnesota musicians over the years, including Alan Sparhawk, Charlie Parr, and Billy McLaughlin. \n\nGaelynn Lea has been actively performing throughout Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin since 2006, contributing to a number of musical projects in the Twin Ports. Currently her most active collaboration is The Murder of Crows, an atmospheric alternative duo with Alan Sparhawk. Together they recorded an EP titled \"Imperfecta\" in 2012. Their original song \"When We Were Young\" was featured on the Sundance Channel's acclaimed drama \"Rectify\" in June 2014. Gaelynn also regularly performs solo sets of experimental fiddle tunes sprinkled with her original songs; her aim is to create a meditative, layered sound that allows the listener's mind to drift. \n\nIn November 2015, Gaelynn Lea released her debut solo album entitled \"All the Roads that Lead Us Home\". It pays homage to the traditional fiddle tunes and beloved standards that Gaelynn has been playing for over a decade… But of course, there is a twist! Gaelynn used her Memory Man looping pedal to create winding layers of sound underneath these familiar melodies. \n\nFrom her album review by Tony Bennett in the Duluth News Tribune: \n\n\"Lea takes a meditative approach, building loops that are based on sustained notes and vibrato, loops that seem like she's scoring a sunrise on a winter morning. Yearning, reaching melodies emerge from the wash of sound and then recede into the background. Chords are flittingly outlined as root notes collide with thirds or fifths or sevenths. It's all very ephemeral and gauzy, and the tracks are easy to get lost in. All the Roads that Lead Us Home is a focused, vibrant piece of music by a person who is able to take a solitary instrument and make it sound like a full string arrangement, who can fill a full-length LP with mostly just those sounds and communicate fluently her heart and soul with only a few tools.\" \n\nOn March 3, 2016, Gaelynn Lea was named the winner of NPR Music's second-ever Tiny Desk Contest. Her music video entry rose to the top of over 6,100 entries from around the nation, chosen as the unanimous favorite among the contest's six judges. The very next week, Gaelynn performed a moving Tiny Desk Concert, at which the show's host Bob Boilen said \"there was hardly a dry eye.\" \n\nA handful of busy months flew by after winning NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest, and somewhere in that whirlwind Gaelynn managed to record a 6-track EP titled \"The Songs \n\nWe Sing Along the Way\". This record was released on August 15th, 2016 and is a blend of Lea's original songs (including the contest-winning number, \"Someday We'll Linger in the Sun\"), traditional fiddle tunes, and her own poetry. \n\nLea identifies equally as a songwriter and a fiddler, so much like her debut solo album, Gaelynn constructed this EP to be a winding exploration of both art forms. However this time around she took a slightly different approach, choosing to collaborate with Minneapolis songwriter, guitarist and percussionist Alan Church (BBGUN, Al Church and State). He skillfully added texture and color to each track as they improvised together in The Pearl Recording Studio in the Twin Cities. Gaelynn Lea hopes this EP will provide her new, wider audience with a sense hope and an appreciation of what the violin can do and has done for hundreds of years. \n\nIn addition to performing and recording, Gaelynn loves to do speaking engagements about disability, overcoming challenges, and the joy of music. Gaelynn has a congenital disability called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or Brittle Bones Disease. In recent years, she has used her music as a platform to advocate for people with disabilities and to promote positive social change. Gaelynn believes society must make accessibility a priority so people with disabilities can participate fully in their communities and use their talents and gifts without discrimination. \n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Karen Dalton and Joanna Newsom melt together in the form of Gaelynn Lea and set about absolutely obliterating your heart.\" -Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys)\n\n\"The way her voice resonates is so unusual and beautiful, like nothing I've ever heard before.\" -Jess Wolfe (Lucius)",

  "artistSummary": "Greetings, music lovers. Allow us to draw attention to the new slab by the emminent and hirsute Steeltown reprobate, Lee Harvey Osmond, aka Tom Wilson aka One of Three Rodeo Kings aka that large, melodic growling man from the former Junkhouse. This record is called “Beautiful Scars,” as in: “Man, that scar is beautiful,” or “She has a beautiful scar right here…” or “My scar is beautiful. It reminds me of that time I didn’t die.” The humanity of the album– produced by Michael Timmins in the intimacy of his Toronto Roncesvalles studio– is like the warmth of blood that rushes to the cut: a sudden jolt in the middle of peril and uncertainty; a suspension of possibility that anything can happen next. Redolent with swooning horns and guitars that bob and weave, LHO’s voice– forever the hallmark of his sound, which spans over three decades of work– sounds, here, like a warm hand to the forehead, an arm on the arm of the stricken, a comforting growl at the heart of a screaming world. At once evoking Howlin’ Wolf, Mike Scott and Roy Loney, “Beautiful Scars” bends and twists and stretches and squeezes LHO’s deep baritone, the producer treating it as if caged in a transistor radio, bathed in echo from above, or sunk in the muck of distortion. The strength of the songs notwithstanding, “Beautiful Scars” is a fascinating vocal journey to rank among the great sonic Canadian records of our time.\n\nThrough the truncheon swing of “Loser for your Love” to the haunting balladry of “Come and Go” to the morose beauty of “Burning in My Bed” to the exotic fusion of the album’s penultimate track, “Black Spruce,” “Beautiful Scars” journeys between the quiet, smouldering, raging, moving and sad. Lyrically, LHO reflects on the mistakes of the singer’s past with the resigned perspective of someone coming through the other side. A song like “Hey, Hey, Hey”– featuring a thrilling slide guitar piece by Aaron Goldstein– describes two lovers caught in the throes of personal despair, their “dreams turned to rust,” their lives waiting until “the morning comes and sweeps us both away.” LHO sings: “The world is fucked up. And so are you and I.” It defines an album, and a songwriter, bereft of any choices other than to keep moving for fear of sinking into the mire of a dark past.\n\nThis is the 3rd solo album from the Hamilton songwriter– the progenitor of “Acid Folk,”– whose previous two albums, “A Quiet Evil” and “The Folk Sinner” were previously long-listed for the Polaris Prize and nominated for a Juno. It’s a dynamic footprint on Canada’s song-scape, a deeply personal, but universally affecting, journey across the jagged line of scars and smoothness of skin that surrounds them.",
