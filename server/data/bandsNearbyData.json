  "artistSummary": "(of The Get Down Stay Down)\nThao (of the Get Down Stay Down) is a San Francisco based band fronted by singer and songwriter Thao Nguyen-She released her fourth album, A Man Alive, on March 4, 2016. Following the critical success of We The Common (2013), which was largely inspired by Thao's volunteer work with the California Coalition for Women's Prisoners, A Man Alive is an evolution in both subject matter and sound. Thao says: \"I wanted A Man Alive to be beat- and bass-driven-rather than guitar-based-extending and elaborating upon the hip-hop influences of the previous record. A Man Alive is more instrumental, more riff- and loop-centric, and has more manipulated sounds.\" The Get Down Stay Down are at their best on this record, and Thao herself experimented with programming drumbeats for several tracks, although live drums are also played on every song. \nMostly recorded at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco, A Man Alive was produced by Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards. Collaborating with Garbus, who is a close personal friend, allowed Thao to achieve the sound she had been striving for on previous releases. \"Looking back,\" she says, \"I was less sure of what I wanted. With this record I had clearer vision and aspirations. I wanted emotion. I wanted power. I wanted beats. Merrill's priority was that I take songs and ideas and run with them; she pushed us all over the place. She carved out time and space for us to experiment at will and fostered a very supportive, creative environment. Everyone was compelled to go beyond what they were comfortable doing. Musician-wise we kept it tight knit because the songs were so personal and vulnerable, and it was such an intense process, I only wanted those who know me well.\" \nA Man Alive finds Thao exploring darker and more personal territory than in her earlier songwriting. She grew up in Northern Virginia, on the outskirts of Washington, DC. When Thao was young, her father left the family. She helped out in her mother's laundromat as a teenager, sitting at the counter with a guitar, making change for customers, working on her first songs, and playing at open mics in the evenings. Her father drifted in and out of their lives. \n\"The record is essentially about my relationship with my dad, its trajectory. It's a document of my life in conjunction with his, even though we've always been leading our lives away from each other. Some are optimistic and forgiving, some are the opposite. There are songs from his perspective: I imagined what it would be like to have kids and choose to exist without them, or feel like you have to save them from yourself. I realized there was this relationship that I never really talk about, realized it's defined so much of me. So it was a point of reckoning. The record wrote itself. Painstakingly, of course.\"\n\nThe emotional center of A Man Alive is the gorgeous, plaintive \"Millionaire,\" a song about a wayward father. While the song could have ended up as a folk ballad, its instrumentation and atmosphere is of a piece with the rest of the album, pushed along by heavily reverbed synthesizer, a simple guitar riff, and subdued drums and bass. \"That's a sad fucking song,\" Thao said. \"I remember walking out of the vocal booth, and I saw Merrill tearing up. It's uncompromisingly sad, which I don't traffic well in. It took a lot.\" \nMuch of A Man Alive is vibrant and danceable-including standout tracks such as \"Astonished Man,\" \"Slash/Burn,\" \"Nobody Dies,\" and \"Meticulous Bird\"-and the juxtaposition of that exuberance with the dark themes explored in the lyrics is one of the album's great achievements. The songs are often punctuated by handclaps, sing-along choruses, and ass-shaking beats. While these songs come from a deeply personal origin, they have such an accessible quality that it is easy to imagine an engaged and participatory live audience. \"I suspect that's always been my motive,\" Thao says, \"but this is the most actualized that it's ever been. I wanted to make a record that was very introspective and personal, but it would also seek to communicate. And we would have fun performing it-not just fun, but I wanted a kind of crazy, rabid, animal energy. That's my favorite thing about performing-you can tap into this frenzy. We want people to dance and feel. And I want to do that every night, too.\" \nA Man Alive is undoubtedly a new career highlight for Thao & The Get Down Stay Down. The album presents a fiercely original group sound that is rife with experimentation and playfulness. It demonstrates Thao's development as a songwriter. And it achieves that most elusive quality in music-to create an album of songs that are dark yet buoyant, tragic yet redemptive, personal yet inclusive.\n\n-Dan Stone",

  "artistSummary": ": The Complete U2 Experience\nThe lights go down, it's dark and the soaring sound of a rock band bound for greatness collides with the low ceiling of a small club. It's like 1978 all over again, when U2 first stormed the pubs of Dublin, Ireland. \nBut this is the 21st Century in San Francisco, and the band is Zoo Station, a quartet that bills itself \"The Complete U2 Experience.\" Since 2001, this talented force has delivered the visual, musical and spiritual thrill of a U2 concert to bars, clubs, outdoor festivals, private parties and corporate events along the West Coast of North America. Singer Bonalmost leads the show, flying high with the vocal strength and confidence of Bono's The Joshua Tree days. The Sledge showers thick layers of effectual guitar work over crowd as Adamesque on bass and Barely Larry on the drums deliver the pounding heartbeat of some of modern rock's most memorable songs. \nThe band's primary job is replication, but periodically Zoo Station innovates as much as it imitates. During their trademark full-album spotlight sets in which the band plays an entire U2 album from start to finish Zoo Station encounters such obscurities as \"Elvis Presley and America,\" \"Promenade,\" \"Red Hill Mining Town\" and \"Acrobat,\" songs rarely or never performed live by U2. \n\"Songs like these are exciting,\" says Bonalmost. \"All we can really do is ask ourselves, 'What would U2 have done onstage?'\" \nMore familiar are melodies like \"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Beautiful Day,\" and \"Vertigo.\" Behind the band, a multi-media visual projection system elevates Zoo Station's performances to the highest level of virtual authenticity. Swirling abstract imagery appears behind the stage, interspersed with rapid-fire \"U2-phemisms\" and in-synch flashing light choreography. All are recognizable from U2 shows, and these visual effects, centerpieced by Bonalmost's lively theatrics, reflect Zoo Station's deep-set love of U2′s music and their commitment to fully recreating the dense emotional impact of a U2 concert. \nSince day-one, when an earnest Craigslist posting sparked the band, Zoo Station has played over 450 shows and now flourishes a repertoire of more than 150 U2 songs. The sing-along radio hits appease casual listeners, while the most loyal U2 fans are wowed by the surprising depth and variety of the set list. Such thrilling rock and roll was made for vast arenas, one-acre stages and sky-high screens, and though U2 quit the bar scene in 1980, Zoo Station thrives there, doing what U2 no longer can: setting the smallest neighborhood pubs burning to life with a sound that has drowned out the world.",

  "artistSummary": "From the beginning,  have been a classic band's band, and a true collaboration: three longtime friends, three songwriters, two singers in a true dual frontman setup, all individuals but all woven more and more tightly together as they have evolved. In a world that rewards drama, reckless moves and often-overwrought narrative twists, The Dig have bucked that trend by focusing on, well, the work: writing song after song to cast off more than they keep, and keep only the best. The Dig do a lot, and they do it the right way — building brick by brick, writing constantly, touring steadily, and most crucially, pushing themselves creatively to make better and better records. Which brings us, of course, to Bloodshot Tokyo, a record rich with ambition and a bright, irresistible ease.\"In the past I think we've tried to create a mindset of writing 'for The Dig'\", says guitarist/keyboard playing Erick Eiser, \"so as to create something cohesive. This time I think we really freed ourselves from that, and just wrote.\" They made the most of their interconnectedness as a way to push themselves forward, writing what singer and bassist Emile Mosseri describes as \"elaborate demos\" for most of the songs. Arrangements were fully worked out, ideas were explored and re-explored before they sat down to record. Emile continues, \"It's not hard to write songs separately, but there's a thing that happens where I'll sometimes have the other guys in my head, even when I'm writing by myself. So in a way, we're kind of always writing together even when we're writing alone. We all grew up playing in different bands together since we were little kids, and have toured with and were inspired by all kinds of different bands for years. I feel like writing this record was the sum of all those years. It's the most wide spanning stylistically and colorful of our records, and also sounds the most like us.\"The result is a tremendously confident record, and one that's far punchier than its predecessors. Even with veritable piles of songs to choose from, it feels oddly apt that Bloodshot Tokyo opens with the brief snippet that is \"Ordinary Mind\". It is a sparkling, hugely inviting riff and a refrain that paves the way, just a small fragment too good to let go of. \"Jet Black Hair\" follows and is an undeniable A-sider, putting the band's pop instincts front and center, never shying away from the groove but never weighed down by it, either. Lead single \"Simple Love\" moves stealthily, winking to just a little something retro but dancing across genres in an exhilaratingly modern way. As a band, The Dig made a choice to turn somewhat from the more ambient sounds of their earlier songs, using those tones as texture to drive songs with other foundations, rather than making it the focal point. Drummer Mark Demiglio, The Dig's relative newcomer, brings a modern pop counterweight to The Dig's moodier side, and it shows. Songs like \"Pool of Rotting Water\" underline that change, going downright beat-driven with just the right amount of glam for a band that is, at its heart, very much a rock band. And what of the records return to love as a theme? Singer and guitarist David Baldwin explains, \"there are elements of both a falling in love and a break up album for sure. I think the songs we picked all generally came from so many different phases and mindsets, there might be different stages in a relationship juxtaposed into the same song. Certain songs may come off like breakup songs but were written while in the peak of a relationship. A kind of regret from the future that hasn't happened yet.\"No band escapes talking about its influences, but its particularly telling that The Dig's members often come back to The Kinks, Harry Nilsson, Betty Harris, Parliament, even Bach — artists who worked in the canon of their eras' pop music, but always with an eye toward upending pop's expectations, fraying the edges, getting weird. Baroque structures and subtle nods pop up throughout , in the low end of \"Bleeding Heart\" or the keyboard swirl of \"Simple Love\", and they permeate the art surrounding this new collection, as well.Everywhere you look these days, there are \"I could do that\"-type cynics. But could they, really? And if they did, could they keep the same wide-eyed spirit The Dig has had for years, since the band's two singers formed their first band as kids? The songs that make up this long-player have a magic borne from that dedication, where tremendous work and discipline meet a lifetime of collaboration and a joyful, insatiable love for songwriting. As it relates to one band's rock record, it may seem strange to point out how cynical the world happens to be right now, but it takes dedication and a deep well of talent to do it like The Dig do it, and do it so well.",

Meticulously written over four years, Shauf’s The Bearer of Bad News is a warm and welcoming album, bathed in weathered piano, dampened drums, softly-strummed guitars and clarinet, which lends its unique timbre to frequently brighten – or hauntingly underscore – the songs’ darker undercurrents. Fans of Elliott Smith, Nick Drake and Harry Nilsson, take note. \nAldous Harding\nAldous Harding’s music is not for the faint of heart. Disarming in its desolate imagery and stark instrumentation, it deals with the raw materials of life: death, birth, grief and love. There are few happy endings, but the power is in how Harding enters into battle; with a dancer’s grace and a boxer’s stance.\n\nSometimes reminiscent of 60s-era folk singers Vashti Bunyan and Linda Perhacs, Harding’s work lies in more harsh terrain than her forebears – piercing the long history of the genre with a grit and sincerity rarely encountered. Somewhat out of step with the 21st Century, Aldous’ music is accompanied by wry wit and tenacious gall that will see her become a true stayer in the music world. \nHailing from New Zealand’s Southern port town of Lyttelton, Aldous has received attention and accolades from some of the most illustrious corners of the music industry. Her self-titled debut album received 4 stars in MOJO and Uncut, while UK blog The 405 hailed her a “toweringly talented song writer”. \nWhile the album was released nearly a year ago in New Zealand, it continues to thrive after releases in Australia and Europe, Aldous’ music timelessly out of step with fleeting trends. Following the Australian release, she played Sydney & Perth Festivals and Golden Plains. She has also toured with Tiny Ruins, Perfume Genius and Laura Jean.",

  "artistSummary": "The Sam Chase has a voice like a Nun on the lam with a mouthful cigarettes and curse words in a lonely bar, drunkenly dancing next to a broken jukebox. His songs are scribbled, not written, on lipstick and sweat stained motel bedsheets because he likes the way the ink bleeds. His guitar runs on diesel and leaks like the morning after too much Whiskey. His is a show you'll probably want to tattoo on your body so everyone will know that you knew him before he was cool.\n\nHailing from the hills of San Francisco, California, Sam and his band whom he lovingly refers to as The Untraditional, take to stages all over the country with a virulent and frenetic passion which many history buffs might liken to the Norse warriors known as The Berserkers, who were known to have fought their battles with an uncontrollable, trance-like fury. Norse literature notes that they would work themselves into a rage before battle, consuming drugged foods, and dressed in nothing but their enemies blood. The Sam Chase and The Untraditional do maintain that spirit, but leave the drugged foods and enemies blood up to the discretion of the crowd. \n\nIn 2012, came the release of his long awaited first studio album, THE SAM CHASE WILL LEAD US TO VICTORY. It took the group all across these United States and back to their home in the Bay Area. The cry came for more, so the band dove head first into writing and preparing a new album. In late May of 2013 THE SAM CHASE WILL NEVER DIE was released. Many children have been conceived to this album since it's release and all of the children who are now born are showing higher than normal levels of intelligence and immunity to most diseases. \n\nAs of the early hours of 2016, Sam and the band have gone back into the studio and laid down 13 brand new tracks. The new album is slated to drop on April 29th, 2016. Many sages and religious fanatics believe that it will bring about the end of days. Stay safe. These are troubled and unpredictable times. \nM. Lockwood Porter\nM. Lockwood Porter’s songs toe the line between country-tinged Americana and straight-up rock-and-roll, with poetic storytelling front and center. A SF Bay Area transplant from rural Oklahoma, Porter’s sound recalls his birthplace and a childhood spent exploring the far reaches of the rock canon. The result is something close to timeless - reminiscent at times of Neil Young, Wilco, Ryan Adams, and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nPorter first caught the attention of many fans and critics with the release of his home-recorded debut LP Judah’s Gone in July 2013. At the time, Independent Clauses called him “a talent to watch”, and The Bay Bridged wrote that he was “poised to join… the national Americana scene with the release of his debut LP, Judah’s Gone.” In October 2014, Porter followed up his promising debut with 27, the bold, carefully crafted work of a talented young artist.\n\nOn 27, we find Porter (who himself turned 27 just before the al) wrestling with a growing awareness of life’s limited possibilities with a mixture of melancholy and defiance similar to that of Carter-era Springsteen, describing failing relationships with a nuanced poignancy reminiscent of Ryan Adams and Lucinda Williams, and eulogizing Big Star founder Chris Bell - who died at age 27 (like Kurt and Jimi, as Porter reminds us) – while name-checking Paul Westerberg and arguing with Neil Young on “Chris Bell”. \n\nIn other words, 27 is a confident-sounding record. That’s a bit ironic for an album that - half breakup record, half quarter-life crisis – is all about the disillusionment and sense of “Is this really all there is?” characteristic of one’s late twenties. But Porter’s willingness to write and sing about the travails and uncertainties of life with courage and honesty is exactly what makes 27 such a compelling album.\n\n27 was primarily recorded in San Francisco’s Hyde Street Studio C - where classic albums like CCR’s Cosmo’s Factory, Grateful Dead’s American Beauty, and CSNY’s Deja Vu were recorded. Showcased on these songs is Porter’s new live band. The band is both tight and spontaneous – sounding something like a cross between Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers, The Band, and Wilco – bringing a rawness and intimacy to the performances that a home recording never could. Porter’s vocals, too, are stronger and more confident – honed by a year of gigging in support of Judah’s Gone. \nThe Dixie Giants\nThe Dixie Giants are a Traditional Jazz group based out of Sonoma County, California.

The lead singer, Antônio Guedes, brings forward various Brazilian influences into his compositions, blending it with others from around the globe, like Afrobeat, American soul, and Latin Jazz, with a psychedelic music twist that suggests to the audience Sergio Mendes, Jerry Garcia, Jorge Ben and Fela Kuti could all be playing in the same band. \n\nThe group was founded in 2012. After a few remarkable shows, they stopped performing due to Guedes’ return to Brazil, where he was living for two years. Not too long ago, in 2015, making his way back up to North American shores, Antônio decided to bring The Chillaquiles band back in action, along with his party/production company BRAZA!. Both band and party have been catching the ears (and the feet) of a fast growing fanbase by producing prestigious nights of funky tropical gatherings, which in the past have awarded him for Hottest Monthly Party by SF Weekly readers.",

  "artistSummary": "Dead Meadow formed in 1998 with Jason Simon on vocals and guitar, Steve Kille on bass, and Mark Laughlin on drums. They began to combine 70s hard rock and 60s psychedelic rock with far out and sometimes mystically minded lyrical themes occasionally even hinting at the obscure genius H. P. Lovecraft and other far out writers of the bizarre and weird.[1] The first album, Dead Meadow, was released in 2000 on Tolotta Records, a label run by Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. The LP version was released by Planaria Records. This was quickly followed by 2001's Howls from the Hills, also released on Tolotta Records. At the completion of \"Howls from the Hills\" John Peel asked Dead Meadow to record a Peel Session which was recorded in Fugazi's home studio, the first time a Peel Session was recorded outside the BBC studios.[1]\n\nn Spring 2002, Laughlin parted ways with the band in order to pursue a career as a lawyer. He was replaced by long-time friend Stephen McCarty ). A live album, Got Live If You Want It, was released in mid-2002, which documented one of the last shows with drummer Mark and was produced by Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre. In early 2003 the band signed with Matador Records and released Shivering King and Others. Along with the heavy song and blues-influenced songs as on the previous two records, the band continued in their psychedelic style, with acoustic elements and ballads. With the addition of second guitarist Cory Shane, Feathers was released in 2005. Simon’s guitar virtuosity is influenced by the droning modal character of Eastern music as by classic rock riffs.\n\nJason Simon is the nephew of The Wire creator David Simon. Dead Meadow's music was used briefly in the episode React Quotes in season five of The Wire.\n\nIn 2007 the band has reverted back to a three piece, made an appearance at the 5th annual Green Man Festival in Crickhowell, Wales and relocated from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn the beginning of 2008, Dead Meadow released Old Growth on Matador Records. A collection of songs that brought the band back initially to the same farm that their second release Howls from the Hills was created and eventually finished up at the legendary Sunset Sound studio in Los Angeles. As with the last three albums Old Growth was produced by bassist Steve Kille.\n\nLater in that same year a brief session with Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother led to the reinterpretation of the Dead Meadow song \"Everything's Goin' On\" as a new song \"Pilgrim\" landing on the second release for Wolfmother, \"Cosmic Egg\".\n\nIn March 2010 the band released a feature length live film and soundtrack, \"Three Kings\", that spotlights their stage show along with psychedelic dream scenarios. The live footage and audio was captured at the bombastic final show of the five month \"Old Growth\" tour. The film premiered at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California[2] and was released on the NYC label Xemu Records, co-run by Kille.\n\nJason Simon also announced his September release of his first solo \"self-titled\" acoustic album on TeePee Records.\n\nThe song \"Sleepy Silver Door\" and \"Greensky Greenlake\" were featured in the skate video \"Emerica, Stay Gold.\"",

Since about 2012, it has made itself known mostly in the basements of Chicago and the greater Midwestern United States as a loud and raw, rock and roll band featuring Kelly’s chiming electric 12-string, the sledgehammer drums of Marc Riordan, Ryan Weinstein’s frenzied bass-lines, and gorgeous harmonic vocal and instrumental accompaniment of Sam Wagster and Gillian Lisee.. It has been reflective of a certain surrendering to the error and tenuous nature of arrangement, and the wet embrace of catharsis, improvisation, rock and roll and the spirit thereof, however physical or metaphysical.",

  "artistSummary": "Between the vast expanses and disparate extremes of space lies “The High Frontier:” a term coined by Gerard K O’Neil in his illustrated 1976 book depicting human colonization of space. In their new thusly titled LP, Lumerians send terrified primates into space in search of wonders both marvelous and harrowing. In a starship powered by gamma-ray-mutated rock, beer-goggled cartographers chart the absurd scales of outer space from subatomic to trans-galactic and the unfathomable void of inner space unbound by physical laws. Inward perception, both fluid and delicate, births, destroys, multiplies and collides temporal realities. Hacking through gnarled carnivorous plants with pyrokinetic machetes, Lumerians thrust forward with Krautrock inspired exploration, Afrobeat’s ritualistic rhythms, post-punk guitar noise and cracked-glacé synth lines culled from perverse 1970’s sci-fi soundtracks. As a followup to 2011’s “Transmalinnia,” “The High Frontier” sets scope outward, points blind-folded at a star map and sets off full blast without making course corrections.\n\nSince forming in 2006, Oakland’s Lumerians have gained notoriety for their intense performances, stunning live visuals and thematic otherworldly releases. Recording from their self-built studio/brewery in a converted store-front church, Lumerians acknowledge the role sound and rhythm have always played in transcendent and ecstatic rituals the world over, from the repetitious drums of tribal animists to the penetrating electronic pulses of neon dance clubs.",

  "artistSummary": "Few bands have the ability to evoke an old-school throwback vibe and yet sound entirely fresh and new at the same time. Royal Jelly is one of those bands. Combining elements of Soul, Rock, Swing and Hip-Hop, Royal Jelly shakes up any dance-party and grooves harder than your typical rock n' roll band dares to go. Fronted by the enigmatic singer Lauren Bjelde, who brings a one-of-a-kind sultry voice to her magnetic stage presence, Royal Jelly leans on the sounds of swingin' horns, gritty keys and a bumpin' rhythm section to carry a crowd into bliss... creating an unforgettable live experience that will leave you wanting more. \nBattlehooch\nBattlehooch is the kind of band you thought went extinct with landline phones & cassette tapes. In one sense they’re a band from another, sturdier era: a band that releases consistently quality material on a consistent basis, a band that doesn’t sacrifice creative drive for commercial interest, a band that grows and evolves with each successive release. From the beautiful madcap mess of debut LP Piecechow to the more refined yet still quite zany jams on Hot Lungs to a cool, polished psych-rock sheen on 2014’s Wink EP, Battlehooch has proven itself as a band built to last. They may possess an old-school mindset, but their music is weird & diverse enough to fit into this wild new century.\n\nFormed in San Francisco, the birthplace of psychedelia, it’s fitting that the six-piece collective echoes the city’s tie-dyed past in its own compositions. However, the group isn’t content with becoming a mere tribute to a time period they never lived through. Instead, Battlehooch updates the sound of psychedelia for a new generation, one that can now access dozens of genres & millions of songs with a few clicks on their iPhones. Battlehooch reflects this modern trend of manic music consumption: on any of their many releases, the listener will be treated to a sonic smorgasbord, bouncing from hard rock to dance-pop to cartoony head trips to flirtations with electronica & jazz & Afrobeat & everything else in between within the span of a few minutes, sometimes even seconds. \nLoco Tranquilo\nLoco Tranquilo is a San Francisco-based ensemble whose music features swirling, percussive jazz and international folk influences.",

  "artistSummary": "Pegi Young & The Survivors\nPegi Young’s powerful new album, Raw, gets right to the point. Opening cut “Why” kicks off with Young’s impassioned alto, demanding, “Why’d you have to ruin my life? Why’d you have to be so mean?” Over the soulful Americana rock of her band the Survivors – led by legendary keyboardist/songwriter Spooner Old- ham – Young taps into a surprisingly primal force.\n\nThere’s a reason for that. Young wrote most of Raw in the wake of her 2014 sepa- ration and divorce from Neil Young, to whom she’d been married thirty-six years. Over the decades, the pair had raised a family, made music together, and worked to support northern California’s Bridge School for severely disabled children. Pegi founded the Bridge School in 1986 after being unable to find the right kind of care for their son, Ben, who has cerebral palsy.\n\n“[Raw] was very cathartic for me,” Young says. “What happened was real, but I also look at this record as having a universal quality to it. I’m certainly not the only one to go through a late-in-life divorce, and I’m not going to be the last. But in my case, it was so painful because we’d shared so many years building a life, together, weathering its ups and downs.\n\nYet the songs – most co-written with guitarist Kelvin Holly and Oldham – aren’t all expressions of anger. The first track to be released from the album is “Too Lit- tle Too Late,” a raw and poetic psalm of regret, the truth-tellin’ “Gave My Best to You” and a rockin’ update on “These Boots are Made for Walkin’” convey resili- ence and sass. A gorgeous, stripped-down version of Don Henley’s “The Heart of the Matter” explores the grace of forgiveness. As a whole, the album is a journey from shock, to rage, to sadness, to strength, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nYoung sees Raw as the soundtrack to the seven stages of grief. “It’s not a linear process,” she says. “You bounce back and forth. And each song could be sung by either party.”\n\nIn addition to chronicling this new chapter of her life, Raw also reflects the music Young has been drawn to since growing up in northern California in the 1960s. “Yes, I remember dancing in the living room to Motown,” she says. “I’ve always loved harmonies, lyrics, and rhythm. I used to go to the Fillmore and the Avalon and Winterland.”\n\nAlthough it would be decades before she would take her work to the stage, Young was writing poetry in grade school and studying it in college. She picked up an acoustic and taught herself some chords and folk covers, and became a bona fide hippie nomad: hitchhiking around the country, with stops in Vermont and Cana- da. By 1972, she’d settled down with her dog in a teepee in northern California. “I bought it for $200,” she says. “My first home.” In 1974, she was working in a res- taurant and living in the teepee when she met Neil Young.\n\nThe rock & roll road, family life, tending to the Young children, and the creation and operation of the Bridge School kept her busy. But by the early ‘aughts, Young, having toured with her ex-husband and spent time in the studio with the best of the best, was ready to become a recording artist in her own right, encouraged by Neil’s longtime manager Elliot Roberts. Two songs written during “the teepee years” ultimately graced her eponymous 2007 debut album. “I mostly set out to do covers,” Young says of that collection. “I was really shy about breaking out my own songs, but about three days into it, my guitarist original lead guitarist, An- thony Crawford convinced me to bring in my stuff.” The country-rock-tinged al- bum also marked her first recorded work with Spooner Oldham and the late pe- dal steel icon Ben Keith, both of whom she’d sang alongside on Neil’s tours. They formed the original core of Pegi Young and the Survivors.\n\nRaw features Oldham and several more recent Survivors, including Muscle Shoals-based guitarist Kelvin Holly, a veteran of Little Richard’s band; drummer Phil Jones; and the newest “Survivor” Shonna Tucker (Drive-By Truckers), who’ve added soulful muscle to the sonic texture. The group lost their original Bassist the renown Rick Rosas in 2014.\n\n“With Kelvin in the band, we’re going to a place in my wheelhouse, more R & B stuff, like Otis Clay’s ‘Trying to Live My Life Without You,’ which also has the great horn sounds [from the TexiCali Horns] and harmonies of the girl groups I listened to as a kid.”\n\nOf her five albums, Raw is the first on which Young is credited with production duties. Her M.O: “Be authentic, be true, sing what’s in your heart. It’s not about making it perfect, it’s about letting it be real, sometimes raw and flawed, as long as it’s true.” This also includes highlighting her band, the Survivors, whose cama- raderie she credits with strengthening and inspiring her. That is most evident on unabashed rocker “You Won’t Take My Laugh Away From Me,” a defiant strut of hard-won confidence that ends with Young’s joyful laughter.\n\n“My laugh has always been rather distinctive,” Young says. “It’s something I can hold on to that’s still mine.” As for the future, Young has started work on a mem- oir and making plans for a tour around Raw’s release. “I am a survivor,” she re- lates. “Although we named the band The Survivors after Ben Keith died, We didn’t have any idea some ten years ago, what an apt name it would turn out to be! I’ve gone through a lot of good stuff and scary stuff, and I will keep going for-ward.”",

  "artistSummary": "Cosmonauts came into being in 2009 in outer space or Orange County, depending on the way you like to look at things. The band was originally formed by Derek Cowart and Alexander Ahmadi after he heard Cowart play a Spaceman3 song solo at a show in their home town of Fullerton, CA. The two were students at different high schools but as it turned out, of the same musical school of thought: two lovers of lo-fi, adorers of the atmospheric, kindred pop-loving spirits. The two bonded over the Velvet Underground and Brian Jonestown Massacre, and quickly turned their mutual appreciation club into a band. Cosmonauts have been making music ever since, picking up bassist James Sanderson and a host of different drummers along the way (the spot is currently filled by Mark Morones). Now residing in Los Angeles, they’ve put out a number of releases (including three full length albums) through Burger Records and various other labels.\n\nThey’ve toured extensively through the US and Europe, and played alongside Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Pixies, Slowdive, Black Lips, Belle & Sebastian, and more, though Cosmonauts don’t exactly fit neatly into the fabric of their scene: too psychedelic to be punk, too punk to be psychedelic, and too absorbed in making their own brand of music to care.\n\nTheir latest offering, A-OK!, is out August 19th via Burger Records. \nThe Molochs\nFirst, let’s meet Moloch. You remember him, right? The ancient god, the child eater, the demander of sacrifice, the villain in Ginsberg’s Howl(and also real life) and now the personal antagonist of singer and songwriter Lucas Fitzsimons, who named his band the Molochs because he knew he’d have to make sacrifices to get what he needed, and because he always wanted a reminder of the Ginsbergian monster he’d be fighting against. And so this is how you make a record right now: you fight for every piece, and when Moloch takes apart your relationships and career potential and leaves you sleeping on couches or living in terrifying apartments and just about depleted from awful people involving you in their awful decisions, you grab a bottle of wine (and laugh at the cliché) and put together another song. And once you do that eleven hard-won times in total, you get a record like America’s Velvet Glory: honest, urgent, desperate and fearless because of it.\n\nFitzsimons came to his calling in an appropriately mythic way, born in a historic city not far from Buenos Aires and raised in L.A.’s South Bay—just outside of Inglewood—where he was immersed in the hip-hop hits on local radio. (Westside Connection!) The summer d before he started middle school, a close friend got an electric guitar, and Fitzsimons felt an enirresistible inexplicable power: “I'd go back home and I’d look up guitar chords on the internet—even though I had no guitar—and just imagine how I WOULD play them. I was slowly getting obsessed.” When he was 12, his parents took him back to Argentina, and on the first night, he discovered a long-forgotten almost-broken classical guitar in the basement of his ancestral home: “It sounds made-up, but it’s true,” he says. “I didn't put the guitar down once that whole trip—took it with me everywhere and played and played. When I got back to L.A., I bought my first guitar practically as the plane was landing.”\n\nThis started a long line of bands and a long experience of learning to perform in public, as Fitzsimons honed intentions and ideas and tried to figure out why that guitar seemed so important. After a trip to India in 2012, he returned renewed and ready to start again, scrapping his band to lead something new and uncompromising. This was the true start of the Molochs: “It didn't make any sense to not do everything exactly the way I wanted to do it,” he says. “I was so shy and introverted that singing publicly sounded like a nightmare come true. But I didn't have a choice—I heard something inside of me and I needed to be the one to express it.”\n\nThe first album Forgetter Blues was released with Fitzsimons’ guitarist/organist and longtime bandmate Ryan Foster in early 2013 on his own label—named after a slightly infamous intersection in their then-home of Long Beach—and was twelve songs of anxious garage-y proto-punk-y folk-y rock, Modern Lovers demos and Velvet Underground arcana as fuel and foundation both. It deserved to go farther than it did, which sadly wasn’t very far. But it sharpened Fitzsimons and his songwriting, and after three pent-up years of creativity, he was ready to burst. So he decided to record a new album in the spirit of the first, and in the spirit of everything that the Molochs made so far: “I wanted to spend less time figuring out HOW we were gonna do something and just actually do it.”\n\nThe result is America’s Velvet Glory, recorded with engineer Jonny Bell at effortless (says Fitzsimons) sessions at Long Beach’s JazzCats studio. (Also incubator for Molochs’ new labelmates Wall of Death and Hanni El Khatib.) It starts with an anxious electric minor-key melody and ends on a last lonesome unresolved organ riff, and in between comes beauty, doubt, loss, hate and even a moments or two of peace. There are flashes of 60s garage rock—like the Sunset Strip ’66 stormer “No More Cryin’” or the “Little Black Egg”-style heartwarmer-slash-breaker “The One I Love”—but like one of Foster’s and Fitzsimons’ favorites the Jacobites, the Molochs are taking the past apart, not trying to recreate it.\n\nYou can hear where songs bend, where voices break, where guitars start to shiver and when strings are about to snap; on “You And Me,” you can almost hear Lou Reed’s ghost call for a solo, and on “I Don’t Love You,” you get that subway-sound guitar and find out what happens when Jonathan Richman’s G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N goes wrong. And of course there’s the charismatic chaos of bootleg basement-tape Dylan—always Dylan, says Fitzsimons—and the locked-room psychedelia of Syd Barrett, especially on “Charlie’s Lips,” Fitzsimons’ ode to—or antidote to—those times when he felt the bleakness completely: “Then a bird lands on a branch nearby, you hear leaves fluttering, you hear a child laughing … all of a sudden things don't seem so bad anymore.”\n\nSo Moloch might still be out there, devouring his sacrifices, but the Molochs are still fighting, too. And that’s why Fitzsimons picked the band name—it’s so he remembers what he’s up against. He’s not celebrating the destroyer of youth and individuality and creativity, he says: “I’m just keeping him in sight so that he doesn't win.” – Christopher Ziegler \nMax Gardener\nMax Gardener makes his self-described “bedroom theme music” amidst the solitude of his California bedroom, and he intends for you to hear it in the solitude of yours.\n\nOn debut record Memory Lounge [Sports Day Records and Citrus City Records], Gardener drifts forth, mixing the sunny trademarks of sixties psych and nostalgia-inducing guitar pop hooks with his omnipresent optimism and a healthy dose of melancholy.\n\n“I was in a weird place,” he says of the recording process, conducted entirely in the privacy of his Long Beach home. “I’d be stuck in my room, recording for a whole day, just drinking coffee and kind of going crazy.”\n\nThe result is a series of kaleidoscopic songs about times past and the days ahead. Memory Lounge contains sparkling multitudes: songs for the beachside happy endings of a teen movie, long nights spent dreaming alone, or endless summer evenings with friends. A lilting guitar bounces along the radiant “Space for the Memories.” On “He Still Loves Her,” Gardener spins bittersweet longing into a shimmering melody reminiscent of The Kinks, The Shins, and The Radio Dept.",

Shortly before releasing their first single \"Demo\" in 2014 the duo became a four piece, with close friend, ex guitar player and singer Ade Martín on bass and one of their first fans, Amber Grimbergen on drums. During the rest of the year and throughout 2015 they embarked on their first world tour, playing everywhere from Thailand, Vietnam and Australia to the United States to the worldwide festival circuit,including SXSW (in which they played 16 concerts in just 4 days), Glastonbury and Burgerama. They have received very positive reviews in Pitchfork, Pigeons and Planes, Gorilla vs. Bear, Paste, SPIN, Entertainment Weekly and NME.Their debut album, Leave Me Alone, made its way into the world on Friday, January 8, 2016 via Mom + Pop Music.Fresh off their release, Hinds is receiving praise for their work. \"This great garage-rock crew from Madrid folds decades of naïf-rock history into its craftily shambling tunes,\" said Rolling Stone. Pitchfork suggests its \"[Carlotta] Cosials and [Ana] Perrote's shared vocal responsibilities, which fit perfectly together\" that \"truly set Hinds apart.\" Entertainment Weekly calls Hinds \"...the year's buzziest indie breakout,\" while SPIN asks \"Whether seeing Hinds live, or listening to their debut album, Leave Me Alone, one question always comes to mind: Can I join?\"",

  "artistSummary": "Howie Day’s emotionally resonant lyrics and inventive melodies have earned him both critical praise and a legion of devoted fans. He is known for his energetic, heartfelt shows, where he connects with audiences through the strength of his songwriting and his quirky sense of humor. Day’s warm tenor voice “soars into fluttering, high registers, but also grates with real, pleading grit,” as one critic put it. After sales of over a million records and two Top 10 hits, Day is back on the road in support of his new studio album, Lanterns.\n\nA native of Bangor, Maine, Day began playing piano at age five and guitar at age 12. By 15, he was writing his own songs and performing across New England. Shortly after graduating high school, Day became a fixture at college coffeehouses across the U.S. He wrote, financed and released his first effort, Australia, which was named Best Debut Album at the 2001 Boston Music Awards. The Boston Globe called Day “gorgeously seasoned, far beyond his years” with “a brave, beautiful singing voice.” During his relentless touring schedule, Day began experimenting with effects pedals and loop-sampling techniques as he performed, layering live percussion with vocal harmonies and guitar parts to become a veritable one-man band. He went on to sell over 30,000 copies of Australia as he navigated the independent music scene and continued to hone his craft.\n\nAfter signing with Epic Records, Day released his major-label debut, Stop All The World Now, and hit the road to support it. The constant promotion paid off: Stop was certified gold in the U.S. and spawned two Top 10 radio hits: “She Says” and the platinum single “Collide.” After three subsequent years of intense worldwide touring, Day moved to Los Angeles and returned to the studio. His next release, Sound the Alarm, built on the emotionally complex spirit of its predecessor and delved into Day’s journey from indie wunderkind to platinum-selling artist. Its lead single, “Be There,” became a staple at modern AC radio.\n\nAfter parting ways with Epic and relocating to New York City in 2010, Day released the Ceasefire EP on his own label, Daze. Over the next two years, as a reenergized Day toured North America, Australia and Asia, new songs began to emerge and evolve. His fourth full-length album, Lanterns, was recorded in Boston with producer and longtime friend Mike Denneen. Awash with a warm musicality and unique instrumentation, the album also features guest vocals from Aimee Mann. Lanterns was released in April 2015.",

The group quickly gained notoriety throughout the Pacific Northwest for their eminently danceable live shows that feature the powerful vocals of frontman Tom Eddy (Beat Connection), bolstered by the deep pocket of their unmistakably detailed rhythm section, and the spirited melodies of “The Honeynut Horns”. Hard-hitting but sensitive, The Dip harkens back to the deep soul roots of the decades past and pays tribute to this history through the grit and grace of their performances. The band's 2015 self-titled debut, recorded to tape at Avast! Studios, propelled them to notable appearances at prodigious festivals such as Sasquatch! Music Festival, High Sierra Music Fest, Summer Meltdown, and Capitol Hill Block Party as well as built anticipation for their 2016 release, Won't Be Coming Back (EP). The band finds themselves prepping for a busy 2017 with a three week national tour scheduled for this Spring, and the release of a brand new single entitled “Sure Don’t Miss You” (vinyl release from Colemine Records). Whether young or old, you can’t help yourself from grinning ear-to-ear when you see these gentlemen hit the stage. I wouldn’t hold back dancing for that matter either!

Like Syd Barrett or Nick Drake before him, Pete Doherty and Alex Turner after him, Ashcroft is one of those rarified rock eccentrics; the type of visionary spirit that’s one of England’s greatest musical exports. As the frontman of The Verve, Ashcroft was the signature voice of 1990s English pop music. The band’s global megahit “Bittersweet Symphony” – which Chris Martin famously called “the best song ever written, sung by the best singer in the world” – made them stars in the States and heroes at home. He’s played Saturday Night Live, graced the cover of Rolling Stone, been nominated for VMAs, GRAMMY’s, and The Mercury Prize but he’s never made a soul record with a hot shot hip-hop producer and venerated Motown greats, until now. In 2009, Ashcroft disbanded The Verve and focused on writing songs inspired by his love of soul, funk and gospel. The result is his first solo album in four years, United Nations Of Sound.",

Music is a reflection of life.”",

The band’s legion of fans grows every year, and the NEVERENDER concept now holds a special place within the culture of the Coheed community. NEVERENDER is the moniker given to these album performances by the band and it first started in 2008, when Coheed performed their first 4 albums over 4 nights – completing the feat in 4 different cities – New York, London, Chicago and Los Angeles. The band’s concept albums lend themselves particularly well to the live setting.\nSimultaneously, singer Claudio Sanchez announced on CBR.com (Comic Book Resources) his plans to release a 12-issue comic book for “Good Apollo” as part of his The Amory Wars series which comes this spring from Boom! Studios. The story, which loosely follows the lyrics of the album, centers around protagonist Claudio Kilgannon and the shocking discovery that he is The Crowing, a entity prophesied about in the holy book, who must dole out God’s judgment to destroy the universe.",

  "artistSummary": "What does deep house, the work of Stockhausen, a self-programmed snake and a frozen Lily Cole have in common? No, it’s not the contents of a lost episode of Skins. Nor is it the XX’s Christmas list. It is, rather, just a few of the details that make up Clean Bandit, a new four-piece that in their playfulness and willingness to trample over musical boundaries offer a refreshing new direction for dance music in 2013. Forget your rock revivalists or your retrofitted soul crooners, Clean Bandit could not have emerged at any time other than now. Comprised of brothers Jack and Luke Patterson alongside the classically-trained pair of Grace Chatto and Neil Amin-Smith, the group formed in 2008. One night , in the dingy confines of a Cambridge nightclub, classic music met bass music, and it never looked back. “It was at the band’s own club night called National Rail Disco. We set it up because we thought there was a real lack of new interesting music at the time. The first ever one was basically set up so we could perform. But as it carried on it became more of a straightforward club night we DJ’d or played live most weeks alongside other DJs and electronic acts we loved.” The students, not normally thought to be a particularly clubby kind of crowd, were into it. “They loved it, it was really successful and always completely packed”, says Jack. “People didn’t expect the students to be into it, but they were. They all had a real appetite for the music. One of the coolest things was the night we had James Blake down. Three quarters of the way through his set he just played a Destiny’s Child acapella on its own. Even though there was no beat,. people just went completely off. That was amazing.” National Rail Disco provided Clean Bandit with a blueprint for everything that was to follow. First, there was a willingness to take risks. Second a desire to blend beats and strings. Third, it was done in a DIY fashion, using whatever resources were to hand.â€¨But first they decided to move to Moscow. Grace to learn the language and play cello. Jack followed her, and ended up enrolling in Russia’s famous film school, The Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. “I didn’t have much to do in Moscow and someone mentioned a film course that was open to international students so I thought I’d give it a try. It was a five year course,” Jack recalls. “I didn’t do the whole thing, but the whole of the first year you only do black and white still images. In the second year you do moving images but still only in black and white. It was all in Russian too, and to begin with none of the students spoke a word of it.” It was at the Gerasimov that Jack’s ideas of blending music recordings with filmmaking began to take shape. “I was making music on a laptop a lot while I was there”, he says. “It was still a hobby though. I had long days at film school and then would come home and have a go messing around making music. I wrote Mozart’s House while I was out there. I was listening to a lot of house music there, there was a little boutique outside our flat that would blast out house for 24 hours. Maybe that seeped in.” Now, in 2013, Clean Bandit are still mixing things up. Currently residing in London, this electroquartet are applying their principles to a whole new range of possibilities. Listen to single ‘A&E’ and you’ll hear classical, bucolic strings intertwining with UK funky bass and a melody of modern electronic pop. It’s a new sophisticated sound, but one that’s distinctive of our capital. The soulful vocals, meanwhile, are sung by guests Kandaka Moore and Nikki Marshall, found by chance in the group’s new home of Kilburn. “They were part of local community singing and dancing group next door to our studio”, says Jack. “We thought they would be perfect for this track.” And so they are, sharing the enthusiasm of the track and, also, the versatility of the group. Moore also volunteered as a dancer for the video, which necessitated her being part of a stop-motion animation. “She was completely unfazed by being painted gold over the course of two hours”, notes Jack. That was far from being the most complicated part of the production, by the way. The video for A&E also required the creation of a golden snake. A serpent that, as in a real life game of Snake, slithered across central London. It was a challenge, one that Jack – typically – took it upon himself to rise to. So how do you make a snake? “We made it on the computer”, he says. “I taught myself to use Cinema 4D. I studied architecture at uni, so I had kind of got into 3d graphics, modeling and animation. Luke learned how to do the fluid dynamics, because the snake had to go through water at the beginning.” Clean Bandit have also been getting a taste of a different experience closer to home whilst on tour this spring with teenage chart conquerors Disclosure. “The tour was really fun”, says Jack. “It was great to see how that world worked and to be in these really cool clubs up and down the country was brilliant. There were screaming fans. We had people who knew the words to our songs, which was quite amazing to see. It was unexpected.”â€¨The stakes were raised even higher for new single ‘Dust Clears’. This concept video, also directed by Jack, was half-filmed on the frozen lakes of northern Sweden in winter. “In this video all the band work in a factory, but the lead singer is an older guy who’s got this fantasy of being an ice skater”, says Jack, with a smile. “We filmed the skating in Sweden and that was great, we used some special techniques. Two of us were towed along on a sled with two different lenses, two cameras filming our dear friend Nick as he skated past. Nick is our friend’s dad and while we were thinking about making the video we heard that when he was 17 he was a Scottish figure skating champion. When you see the video, you’ll see why we found this quite amazing.” Quite clearly kids of the internet generation, Clean Bandit aren’t precious about where they find inspiration or how they deploy it (the aforementioned Lily Cole volunteered to stand in a freezing cold swimming pool for the video to UK Shanty, in return for Jack giving her a tutorial on her new video camera). Neither are they devoted to one type of creativity. They make music, they make video, they perform live. “We try to think of each piece as being a music video rather than a song”, says Jack. “Videos for songs is the output. That’s how we’d like it to be digested. Now we’re doing more and more music, we’re having to make stuff without the videos, but hopefully we’ll be able to catch up.”",

It turns out, though, that once the door’s open, it never closes. That’s because the Melbourne septet has ingeniously crafted what may be the world’s first infinitely looping LP. Each of the nine, complex, blistering tracks on ‘Nonagon Infinity’ seamlessly flows into the next, with the final song linking straight back into the top of the opener like a sonic mobius strip. It’s exactly the kind of ambitious vision that prompted Rolling Stone to dub the band “one of the most compelling collectives of art-rock experimentalists in recent years.” But far from a simple conceptual experiment, the album is both an exhilarating shot of adrenaline and a remarkable feat of craftsmanship, the result of painstaking planning and an eye for detail years in the making.",

Belting out rocking blues from France to the eastern states and Canada with her band “Blue Heat”, her special blend of hard rocking blues, gospel and roots brought out a voice unique in its depth, universal in its world weariness.\n\nAfter a long break working in the non-profit world, Lembo is coming back with a fury. Her voice, preserved in the break continues to evolve and reflects the depth of life and the world around us. She has spent the last several years writing her 5th release titled “45 Miles”and will begin recording in the summer of 2015.\n\nWhen asked to sum up her last 15 years, Lembo says this: “The purpose of my semi-retirement from music was to discover who I am off the stage. I had spent most of my life prior either on the stage or, trying to get on it. The irony is, the work I was doing often times brought me on stage to talk with hundreds or even, thousands of people. I guess it is just who I am. That said, I’m much more interested in evolving and growing as a musician than trying to be a rock star. I’m fascinated by how music heals, moves, motivates and brings us together in community. It is a spiritual quest now, the wannabe rock star days behind me. I wasn’t very good at it anyway. I’m much better at being part of the whole of the experience as opposed to being the focus. ”\n\nLook for Lembo’s upcoming album, “45 Miles” 2016.",

  "artistSummary": "Tim Cohen\nTim Cohen wants make you aware of life’s imperfections; he likes to play devil’s advocate…or maybe he's more like the devil’s buddy, offering up his own dark but playful asides. On Luck Man, the Fresh & Only’s and Magic Trick frontman’s first solo record for Sinderlyn, Cohen has created a lush, insular world that deals with the uneasiness of accepting life’s inherent flaws. \n\nRecorded in his attic and at El Studio in San Francisco after recently moving back to a city he longed called home, Luck Man is a personal statement distilled from Cohen’s own experiences. “I draw upon little moments and memories to make music,” he says. “I like to think I’m leaving bits of wisdom behind, but I don’t possess the wisdom for longer than it takes to make a song. I inherit it momentarily, write it down, attach a melody that fits the words in rhythm, and then record it.” Attempting to answer the unanswerable, Cohen aims to fill this existential void with his songwriting.\n\nThe intricacies of tracks like “I Need A Wife” and \"John Hughes\" belie Cohen’s seemingly simple writing process where warmth and comfort meets a questioning anxiety. However, there's always more to each song than meets the eye. Influenced by Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece as well as his one-time day job as a delivery driver (see \"Meat Is Murder\") and other daily travails, Cohen eschews focusing on overarching topics like love, hope or despair and, instead, creates his own stories with fleeting, yet quietly complex characters and thoughts. \n\nAfter over a decade of writing and releasing music under various monikers, it's clear that Cohen is more than capable of producing a beautiful record, whether or not you want to dig deeper into life's nagging paradoxes is solely up to you.",

Enamored of her mother’s rock- and soul-heavy music collection, she sang throughout school, picking up guitar, bass and songwriting as a teenager. She earned her GED and left high school early, then pursued music studies at the local junior college. A period of woodshedding, gigging and recording ensued, culminating in the release of Pi’s debut album. She spent two years in New York before landing in L.A., which has proven fertile creative ground and a convenient base for touring. \"A Little Blue\" is Pi’s seventh record, coming March 31, 2017 on The Travianna Records label. \n\nA LITTLE BLUE\n\nOn tour in late 2016, in the tiny town of Floyd, VA. Pi met the head of Mountain Fever Records, the premiere US bluegrass label. Mark Hodges, the president of Mountain Fever, immediately signed Pi to his new Americana label, Travianna Records. In between European and US touring last year, Pi went out to Floyd to work with Producer and multi-instrumentalist, Aaron Ramsey. The result is a true collaboration of Pi's “Americana bluesy rock thing,” and Aaron's deep bluegrass roots. A truly unique album, \"A Little Blue\" will be released in March of 2017. We can't wait!",

Media fans include Curve Magazine (“storytelling at its best” ) and Diffuser Magazine (“an impressive catalogue of unforgettable stories.”) Garlin’s songs have also aired on Click and Clack's Car Talk, NPR’s Democracy Now, and radio stations throughout the country. Her live performances bring together a natural stage presence and the same folk, rock, and Americana flavors that season her recordings.",

  "artistSummary": "The Dull Richards\nThe Dull Richards are a four piece rock and roll string band based in San Francisco, formed in 2011 in the open-mic circuit over a love of banjos, songwriting, and pizza. They give modern attitude to old-time music, blending bluegrass, country, rock and roll, folk, and traditional music in original acoustic arrangements.\n\nJosh Johnson and Reese Douglas share singing and songwriting duties, trading off on guitar and banjo. Josh writes thoughtful narratives, combining strong bluegrass and traditional roots with elements of folk-pop that make his songs catchy and unforgettable. Reese writes foot stomping country and rock and roll tunes that say it straight and make people move. Brendan Getzell puts the shine on top with his effortless mandolin and vocal harmonies, and Adam Thompson keeps it all steady on the upright bass. Their most obvious influences would be Neil Young, Earl Scruggs, the Byrds, Uncle Dave Macon, Joni Mitchell, Bela Fleck, Soundgarden, and Jerry Jeff Walker, but they also take cues from jazz, classical, and a wide variety of folk traditions.",

  "artistSummary": "Eliza Rickman\nThere is always a hint of menace and reservoirs of force haunting the corners of Eliza Rickman’s voice, whatever register it occupies. Her presence on stage- whether she wears flowers in her hair, or stuffed birds; whether she plays a toy piano or a grand piano- is an enveloping, soft darkness, impossible to ignore. It has been three years between Rickman's first album, O, You Sinners, and her newest effort, Footnotes for the Spring. In those intervening three years, Rickman added the autoharp to her repertoire, fought illness and heartbreak (and won), and turned 30. But mostly, she toured. She is a frequent featured musical act for the live rendition of the popular podcast Welcome to Night Vale, she joined the band Rasputina for a handful of dates, and she organized her own successful solo European tour.\n\nDuring those three years, Rickman’s vocal delivery has also developed a new breathlessness. She wrote all the string arrangements on her debut. But friend Jason Webley produced and orchestrated Footnotes. Here, Rickman’s voice casts its shadow against Webley’s shimmering strings and a Phil Spector style wall of sound, flecked with melancholy and nostalgia. This clutch of songs comprises, among others, “Lark of my Heart”, written to commemorate the wedding day of Margaret Rucker, an unknown poet whose scrapbook was found in a dumpster many years after her death; “Now and Then”, whose opening lines encapsulate the juxtaposition at the heart of the album- Oh, to be young again/blood is on my hands- and “Wax Nostalgic”, whose title speaks for itself. But this is nostalgia without sentimentality. Rickman’s voice has the power to hold the smallest grain of sadness, an intimation that the longed-for innocence depicted in her lyrics has slipped just below the glow of the orchestra and out of sight.",

  "artistSummary": "Harlow's Monkeys\nSome bands are born out of the desire to look cool and get laid. Some bands just happen. Harlow’s Monkeys is certainly the latter; fronted by Bay Area native, Tommy P, he teams up with New York City’s sister duo, King Willow. The result is a lush weary sound that’s introspective, yet abundantly hopeful. \n\nTommy’s lyrical style is very simple, yet is capable of addressing with full poignancy the heart of the matter, whether it's unrequited love or the existential ennui that plagues us modern humans. People often comment on the ambiance Tommy’s songs have on a room, whether it's slightly unsettling, welcoming or humorous, it can’t be ignored, and won’t fail to make an impression. Harlow’s Monkeys is a band that functions around the idea that music should be provocative and true. While some may claim that we are “post the truth,\" Harlow’s Monkeys firmly believes that all beings recognize truth when they see or hear it. This band’s music will take you through the journeys or emotions that you may have long forgotten, or that you’re currently going through. \n\nIn any case, listeners will often finish a Harlow’s Monkeys record feeling refreshed by the archetypical stories funneled through the quirky yet provocative voice of Tommy’s writing fleshed out by various good friends and musicians that make up the San Francisco music scene.",

  "artistSummary": "There’s something romantic about a band’s early days. A sense of innocence, optimism, and wonder courses through the music. In the summer of 2014, No Doubt’s Tony Kanal [bass], Tom Dumont [guitar], and Adrian Young [drums] and singer Davey Havok [AFI, Blaqk Audio] began writing and demoing music together. Without telling a soul outside of their significant others, the four musicians clandestinely moved into a cramped downtown Los Angeles rehearsal spot and revved up what would become DREAMCAR.\n“It reminded me of the early days of No Doubt when we were jamming in an Orange County garage,” recalls Dumont. “We felt that same sense of freedom. There was no label, no manager, no agent, and no roadies.”\n“For a good year-and-a-half, it was just the four of us making music,” adds Kanal. “We had this opportunity to be a new band again. That’s a very special thing to be able to do. We were just making music to make music.”\nThe union of Kanal, Dumont, Young, and Havok pre-dates those magical jam sessions. Paths crossed in the music industry as they do, but Young can recall standing on the side of the stage and watching Havok with rapt attention as Blaqk Audio opened for No Doubt in 2012. “Davey was super charismatic,” says the drummer. “It was powerful to watch.”\n“He was fearless to come from the punk world and do something that flies totally in the face of that,” agrees Dumont. “We found that sense of bravery exciting. We didn’t ever want to be constrained by unspoken rules of a scene or anything like that, and he was like-minded.”\nWhen Havok heard the first four demos, the music immediately resonated, transporting him back to his childhood fascination with the celebrated New Romantic movement. “It was very fun, because the songs touched on an aspect of my creative inspiration and musical upbringing that has never been directly touched on before,” admits Havok. “When it comes to some of the most informative musical moments for me, Duran Duran and Culture Club were the earliest cassette tapes I ever bought.”\nRife with shimmering guitar tones, percussive slap bass, bombastic drums, and a neon-lit dancefloor dreaminess, DREAMCAR gleefully nods to the decade of Boy George and Back to the Future through a kaleidoscope of wisdom earned from three decades creating and connecting with fans worldwide. Signing to Columbia Records, the boys are finishing off recording their 2017 self-titled debut with producer Tim Pagnotta [Neon Trees] in a North Hollywood studio.\n“DREAMCAR speaks to a nostalgia, but as much as it speaks to the past, it also speaks to the present and the future,” Havok goes on. “It mirrors hopes, aspirations, and attaining the unattainable. I would hope the songs do the same thing.”\n“On the surface, a dream car is a very male ideal,” says Dumont. “You think of that question, ‘What’s your dream car?’ Everyone will have a different answer. If you go a little deeper, it’s like a vehicle for dreams.”\nUltimately, it’s that combination of delectable and dangerous which will leave listeners everywhere satisfied. “This is a big moment for us,” Kanal leaves off. “It’s a new beginning. We can’t wait to perform the songs live!”\n“I’d love for people to get a cinematic feeling,” concludes Young. “If they hear it and want to see us live, that would be amazing. Let the dream begin.”\nTICKET INFORMATION• Great American Music Hall is an ALL-AGES (6+) venue.• No refunds or exchanges are permitted, except in the case of headliner cancellation or date change.

  "artistSummary": "Simply put,  has spent nearly 25 years making music that defies description. While the Chicago-based instrumental quintet has nodded to dub, rock, jazz, electronica and minimalism throughout its revered and influential six-album discography, the resulting sounds have always been distinctly, even stubbornly, their own.\nIt's a fact that remains true on \"The Catastrophist,\" Tortoise's first studio album in nearly seven years. And it's an album where moody, synth-swept jams like the opening title track cozy up next to hypnotic, bass-and-beat missives like \"Shake Hands With Danger\" and a downright strange cover of David Essex's 1973 radio smash sung by U.S. Maple's Todd Rittmann. Throughout, the songs transcend expectations as often as they delight the eardrums.\nTortoise, comprised of multi-instrumentalists Dan Bitney, John Herndon, Doug McCombs, John McEntire and Jeff Parker, has always thrived on sudden bursts of inspiration. And for \"The Catastrophist,\" the spark came in 2010 when the group was commissioned by the City of Chicago to compose a suite of music rooted in its ties to the area's noted jazz and improvised music communities.\nTortoise then performed those five loose themes at a handful of concerts, and \"when we finally got around to talking about a new record, the obvious solution to begin with was to take those pieces and see what else we could do with them,\" says McEntire, at whose Soma Studios the band recorded the new album. \"It turned out that for them to work for Tortoise, they needed a bit more of a rethink in terms of structure. They're all pretty different in the sense that at first they were just heads and solos. Now, they're orchestrated and complex.\"\n\"All of the songs went through a pretty intensive process of restructuring,\" adds Parker. \"We actually had quite a lot of material that we ended up giving up on. Oftentimes, we'll shelve ideas and come back to them years later.\"\nThe album's single \"Gesceap\" embodies the transformation of the original suite commissions, as it morphs from two gently intersecting synth lines into a pounding, frenzied full-band finish. \"To a certain extent it's more of a reflection of how we actually sound when we play live,\" says McEntire of Tortoise's heavier side. \"That hasn't always been captured as well on past albums.\"\nElsewhere, \"Hot Coffee\" resurrects an idea abandoned from the band's 2004 album \"It's All Around You,\" gliding through only-on-aTortoise-album sections of funktastic bass lines, straight-up dance beats and Parker's fusion-flecked guitar bursts. \"It's progressive experimental music with pop sensibilities,\" says Parker.\n\"Rock On,\" which McEntire says he and McCombs simultaneously had the idea to cover after having remembered hearing it on the radio all the time as kids, isn't the only vocal moment on \"The Catastrophist.\" Also included is the bittersweet, honest-to-goodness soul ballad \"Yonder Blue,\" sung by Yo La Tengo's Georgia Hubley. \"We'd finished the track and decided it would be good to have vocals on it,\" recalls McEntire. \"Robert Wyatt was our first choice, but he had just retired and politely said no. We were discussing asking Georgia to do something, but not that track in particular. Then we realized it would totally work.\"\nTortoise is planning an extensive world tour in support of \"The Catastrophist.\" Admits McEntire, \"figuring out how to reproduce these songs live will be a bit of a challenge. But I also feel like it might be time to dip into the back catalog a bit. The pool we draw from has been really consistent for quite awhile.\nAs ever, Tortoise has conjured sounds on \"The Catastrophist\" that aren't being purveyed anywhere else in music today. There's a deeply intuitive interplay between the group members that comes only from two decades of experimentation, revision and improvisation. And at a time when our brains are constantly bombarded by myriad distractions, \"The Catastrophist\" reminds us that there's something much greater out there.

  "artistSummary": "Of course you don’t need to attach more importance to this piece of news than it necessarily has, but it certainly deserves to be mentioned: for the first time in more than 20 years, one of the most British rock bands in music history has recorded a studio album in their native country. Their latest offering is entitled A Conspiracy Of Stars, was cut by rock legend  and breathes that typically British easy-going confidence for which this band has been known for over 45 years. A strong release consisting of eleven songs which combine everything that the group surrounding frontman Phil Mogg stands for: meaty riffs, distinctive hooks, diverse songwriting, intelligent lyrics and that generally laid-back attitude which we have associated with UFO from the start. The fact that A Conspiracy Of Stars was produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore, among others) may be considered another successful element in a thoroughly consistent release. To cut a long story short: their 22nd studio recording to date sees UFO prove that past and present can be blended in a homogeneous whole.",

There was the music to get to; itself essentially reference-less and unqualifiedly unique. But what of the guy who created it? The guitarist who wrote the whole thing, who played every instrument. An enormous unknown talent without an attendant backstory to match the spectral and boundless qualities of his music. Enter Chuck Klosterman. The celebrated writer was brought on to completely fabricate a biography based on a band and album he was asked not to listen to.",

Born on the Jazz & Heritage Festival stage, and descended from Neville family bloodlines, these soldiers of funk ignite a deep, gritty groove that dares listeners not to move. Their performances combine ingenious musicianship and complex funk and jazz arrangements with soulful melodies that are simple enough for anyone to enjoy. In Big Easy tradition, dueling baselines from Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III set off one of the dirtiest rhythm sections on the planet, while Ivan Neville lights up the Hammond B3 keys and cousin Ian Neville’s funky guitar riffs send the groove into overdrive. The band recently welcomed their newest member, Alvin Ford Jr. to the quintet, a New Orleans born and raised powerhouse drummer. Dumpstaphunk tosses around lead vocals and four-part harmonies the way Sly & the Family Stone did, but with three studio albums under their belt, Dumpstaphunk stands on the merit of their own material. Songs like “Dancin’ To The Truth” off their latest record, Dirty Word (Red Hot Records), offer an escape into the funky sublime, sharing the true spirit of New Orleans with every note.",

An amazing live band with a rabid following, the Washington Post called GBV \"the Grateful Dead equivalent for people who like Miller Lite instead of acid!\"\nAfter 22 albums, 24 solo records and countless side projects, Pollard has recorded a new GBV album by himself and has assembled an exciting new GBV line-up for 2016 touring: Doug Gillard (guitar), Bobby Bare Jr (guitar), Mark Shue (bass) and Kevin March (drums).",

Most recently Lahey has set the music industry abuzz with the insanely catchy You Don’t Think You Like People Like Me. From the attention-grabbing opening bars (those drums sound like an angry landlord thumping your front door on a Sunday morning), it flips the classic break-up line “it’s not you, it’s me” on its head. Upon release in March, People… was immediately added to rotation on triple j, triple j unearthed, Syn FM and FBi FM, and started popping up on music blogs everywhere. It was then Pitchfork gave it Best New Track and got the rest of the world talking. A founding member of avant poppers Animaux, multi-instrumentalist Lahey has now gone solo and pared down her sound, embracing a simple, home-spun story-telling style that’s often underlined by her second love, the fuzz pedal.",

  "artistSummary": "Drink in hand, his bowtie hanging, the Western Australian-born Cameron Avery has arrived as a new breed of nocturnal crooner, a train-wreck romantic creating timeless, ambitious music for the modern age. \n\n \n\nUtilizing his soulful wit, shrewd arrangements, and a deep, husky baritone, Avery harnesses the dark power and humor of artists like Nick Cave, Scott Walker, and Tindersticks to expertly walk the fine line between vulnerable and venerable.\n\n \n\nHailing from the late 2000’s-era Perth and a healthy scene of hard-hitting garage rock bands, including a long stint as the drummer of Pond, Avery found his musical footing while playing with friends but sought the reward of his own outfit. Encouraged by his friend Kevin Parker of Tame Impala to record on his own, Avery started The Growl as his solo project in 2007, making an EP and an album of aggressive, distorted psychedelic rock and roll. When Parker asked him to join Tame Impala as its touring bassist in 2013, Avery jumped at the chance and rose with that band to the top of the psych-rock heap, but all the while remained focused on carving out his singular identity as an artist and following his own muse.\n\nWhen a longer break for Tame Impala arrived, Avery decided to head to the US to continue work on his album. Melancholic machismo is written into the very DNA of Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams. From the classical, finger-picked guitar on the opener “A Time and Place” and the orchestral vamping of “Do You Know Me By Heart?” to the bombastic, self-assured swagger of “Dance with Me.” He takes an emotive page from the Leonard Cohen songbook-of-longing on “Big Town Girl” just as naturally as he thumbs an aggressive note of Bad Seed strut and Cramps rut on “Watch Me Take It Away.” And by the time he purrs that earnest refrain of “Baby, it’s you” on the album’s closer “C’est Toi,” Avery has surely mastered that drunken tightrope dance.",

The results are sometimes gentle, sometimes ferocious and always show-stopping, with her commanding vocals front and centre.\n\nThe debut single from Vera Blue is Hold, the bewitching first taste of a five-track EP. Written together with veteran producers Andy and Tom Mac and Melbourne songstress Gossling, Hold matches acoustic guitar with piano, production and Vera Blue’s candid songwriting. The result is real, raw and powerful, with the purity of folk music and the punch of a bassline.",

  "artistSummary": "Intimate can be loud. Rambunctious can be endearing. Heartfelt can be lighthearted. POWERS introduced themselves to the world on that premise. And it listened. Their recent romping bursting, single, \"Beat of My Drum\" shot up to the top of the Hype Machine popular page instantaneously after its summer release, and found itself on top of Spotify's viral charts and iTunes Emerging Artists spotlight. Following up with an equally impactful, \"Loved by You\", the 2 most recent releases have garnered nearly 5 million plays in just two months. The band's first track last fall was featured globally on ad campaigns for J. Crew & Mastercard. Indie Shuffle has called them \"Infectious and damn right catchy\", and Stereofox encouraged us to look up indie-pop in the dictionary (they said we'd find the song there - we did). \n\nPOWERS is Mike Del Rio and Crista Ru. If you haven't heard their names, rest assured, you've heard their tunes. After Mike Del Rio inked a publishing deal with Alex Da Kid (Rihanna's \"I Love the Way You Lie\", Imagine Dragons), his writing and productions started popping up on TVs, playlists and radios everywhere. After working with top pop artists such as Selena Gomez, Kylie Minogue, & Cee Lo Green, Mike most recently made waves by producing the anthemic X Ambassadors ft Jamie N Commons & Jay Z \"Jungle\" and executive producing The Knocks \"So Classic\" EP (of which POWERS wrote and featured on the title track \"Classic\"). On the flip side of this creative powerhouse is writer Crista Ru. Aside from lending her breathy vocals and exquisite toplining to POWERS, her credits read like a who's who of the recent pop landscape. From penning the lead tune from Selena Gomez's most recent release to working with Swedish pop duo Icona Pop, Ms. Ru has a poignant knack as an artistic muse and a searing-hot songstress, stirring the two together to create electrifying performances.\n\nWith a versatile background in crafting both sonic and melodic textures, it's clear that this LA duo is poised to continue their blossoming ascent as these two tunesmiths are doing classic popular songwriting with a biting and prescient sense of modernity. With POWERS, one listen will loop your ears and your heart. And in 2015, that's a rarity that you're going to want to hit repeat on over and over again. \nBRIDGIT MENDLER\nWhen Los Angeles-based musician and actress Bridgit Mendler stepped back into the studio for the first time in four years, she knew it was going to feel different. Heart-break, self discovery, and fresh musical inspiration set her on a new path “to make something raw – something genuine”. Entwining pop with hip-hop, alternative R&B, indie rock, and even dancehall, Bridgit Mendler has emerged with a career-changing work. Her EP Nemesis is out now, which includes singles “Atlantis” featuring Kaiydo, and “Do You Miss Me At All.” \n\nUpon sharing “Atlantis,” the track hit #2 on Spotify’s Viral Chart, #1 on HypeMachine, and garnered over four million streams across platforms within 1 week. Bridgit also revealed the official “Atlantis” video with VICE’s Noisey who dubbed it “a masterwork in craft and atmosphere.” Bridgit's latest single is the soulful, rhythmically tugging “Do You Miss Me at All.\"",

  "artistSummary": "IAN SWEET started in 2014 with a string of text messages. Jilian Medford was a few days away from embarking on her first tour when the driver and drummer she recruited cancelled. Medford sent IAN SWEET drummer Tim Cheney -- whom she barely knew -- a series of desperate messages, asking if he knew how to drum and whether or not he would be willing to take two weeks off of life to go on tour. Cheney responded soon after with a simple: \"Yes.\"\n\nWhile she was writing Shapeshifter, Medford's life was in turmoil. She ended an emotionally abusive relationship in Boston, graduated from Berklee College of Music, and briefly moved home to the San Fernando Valley, thinking she would stay there. Medford was unsure of the band's future and suffering from a severe, undiagnosed panic disorder. When she returned to Boston to record the album in July of 2015 alongside Cheney and bassist Scalise, Medford was reminded of everything she'd hoped to escape after graduation. She felt stagnant; trudging through a quicksand made up of heartbreak and severe depression, a process she references on Shapeshifter stand-out \"Slime Time Live.\"\n\nThat's one of many lighthearted, nostalgic references on the album that subvert the pain beneath. Like its title suggests, most of the songs on Shapeshifter don't settle in a particular scene so much as they delve into a sensibility. Whether Medford's singing about Slime Time Live, eating ice cream in bed on \"All Skaters Go To Heaven,\" or honoring her favorite athlete Michael Jordan on \"#23,\" Medford displaces loneliness by falling in love with the small things that make her happy; like skateboarding, basketball, candy, and her preferred footwear: Crocs.\n\nAccompanied by Cheney and Scalise's playful instrumentation, Shapeshifter becomes a celebratory purging, an album that finds humor in self-deprecation and vice. IAN SWEET's debut interrogates capital-e Existence through a candy-coated lens, their mathy precision scaffolding the chaos of Medford's personal neurosis and turning those anxieties into something hook-laden and relatable. \nPost Life\n4 piece Wonder-Punk-Gaze-Wave from Los Angeles.",

As a band we feel that we’ve never had an opportunity to deliver the live show in the U.S. that represents the band at its best, and on this tour that is what we finally intend to do. We’re sorry to all our fans there that it’s taken us so long—we've faced all sorts of obstacles, some of which you are well aware of, but we intend to make the wait more than worthwhile.”\nArchitects’ spring tour marks their first U.S. visit in support of their latest album, All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us. Released in May 2016, the band’s seventh studio album.\n“In an album full of loud noises, the loudest noise above all is the sound of every other metalcore band choking on Architects’ dust.” - Metal Hammer (9/10)\n“Continuing to evolve their impressive taste on metal core.\" - Revolver\n“It’ll shake your body.

  "artistSummary": "You can count the number of bands who've stayed together for 20 years on two hands, and you can use just one to count those who've consistently released quality material for two decades. This year, The Bouncing Souls enter that esteemed category, and in keeping with their D.I.Y. roots, they've done it without major labels, corporate radio, MTV, or teen magazine pinups.\n\nWhen married couples celebrate twenty years together, they're usually showered with anniversary gifts. The Bouncing Souls are celebrating their milestone by reversing that tradition and giving back to the fans, releasing one original song per month throughout 2009. More on that later, but first let's look back on some earlier days…\n\nPicture it: 1989, a Knights of Columbus Hall in Bernardsville, New Jersey. A supportive music-loving teacher throws down $120 to cover expenses. A bunch of sweaty high school kids gather to sneak beers and rock all night at the debut show of a band called The Bouncing Souls. And a Jersey institution is born.\n\nBut the Souls' story actually begins a few years earlier than that historic gig. \"Pete [Steinkopf] and Bryan [Kienlen] had a cover band called The Switch around '86 and '87,\" recalls frontman Greg Attonito. The band was largely booked at parties teeming with college chicks and kegstands, and occasionally, their friend Attonito would join in to channel his inner Roger Daltrey or Billy Idol.\n\n\"Then we started another band called Brad Karma and the Absent Minded Fruit Bats,\" says guitarist Steinkopf. \"There was one song that we had called 'Quest For Goodie' and Greg would jump around and sing all kinds of crazy shit to it off the top of his head. We were all teenagers growing up in the suburbs, just looking to create our own fun.\"\n\nThe threesome spent ever more time hanging at shows in New York City and haunting Trenton's legendary, late, great City Gardens. The chemistry was undeniable and unstoppable, and it wasn't long before their creative juices flowed together. Tapping original drummer Shal Khichi, the band holed up in Greg's dad's attic and started writing what would make up the early Souls songbook.\n\nLike any young band with energy to burn and original songs under their belt, the boys took to the road in order to share their music and spirit with any crowd that would listen. While there were aspirations to find audiences across the globe, even college parties and basements were enough to keep hope alive in the early days. As bassist Kienlen puts it, \"We never spent too much time worrying about the future. The point of the band was always celebrating the here and now, trying to make the best of whatever was in front of us at the time.\"\n\nThough it wasn't until 1995 that the band was able to tour on a full-time basis, they soon found the road to be a more frequent home than the comfort of their own beds. From headlining tiny rooms in remote towns to playing Wembley Arena with Green Day and Tokyo's Budokan with My Chemical Romance to spending time on seven different editions of Vans Warped Tour (totalling 11 months, with more sure to come), The Bouncing Souls have clocked more travel time than most airline pilots.\n\nSince 1996, the band has had a constant traveling companion and honorary fifth member - their primary touring vehicle, lovingly called The White Castle. For ten years, she gave dutiful service, until The Gold Tour, when her engine gave out - with 300,000 miles on the odometer. Regarding her decade of service before temporary retirement (the proceeds from that tour are rebuilding the old gal's guts), Attonito says, \"We converted those miles into road hours. Estimating about 40 MPH - because a lot of them aren't highway miles, with plenty of time sitting in traffic - it was staggering. Our estimate rounded out to 333.33 days driving in our truck! No exaggeration: that's about a full year!\"\n\nFortunately, there are many more tour dates in store for both the band and their beloved Castle. Exactly how many of those dates is impossible to say, though, since the band hasn't exactly been keeping score. \"I'd love to figure out how many shows we've played...I wish we kept count,\" says Steinkopf. \"I know bands that have and it's awesome. It must be way up in the thousands by now, though.\"\n\nFrequent attendees of those gigs (true believers, all) hail the Souls as one of the best bands in the world, and the boys feel the same devotion to their fans. \"Bouncing Souls fans are the greatest friends ever,\" enthuses Attonito, \"They're passionate and full of life. They really are part of the band in the sense that we're plowing a path through life together in good times and in bad.\"\n\n\"It's pretty much across the board too,\" adds Steinkopf. \"every age group...all different kinds of people. My favorite is when we meet people that were there from the start and now they have kids of their own that they bring to our shows. We really are a part of each others' lives.\"\n\n\"And any time someone says you've influenced them certainly makes an impact on you. To know that someone has looked at something you've done and they have taken something from it - whether it be in a lyric or the way you play your instrument - has got to be the highest compliment paid,\" says drummer Michael McDermott. As a final piece of evidence, Kienlen points to the MySpace gallery of band-based tattoos adorning their admirers: \"Last I checked it's up to almost 300 and counting. Our fans are hardcore in their unwavering support. We really are one big family.\"\n\nAnd families share things, which is why this year, the Souls have decided to gift their family of friends and fans with twelve spanking new songs, available for the standard less-than-a-buck download on the first of each month in '09, or for purchase on 7\" vinyl in quarterly compilations on their own Chunksaah Records (each featuring one additional bonus track).\n\nSteinkopf elaborates: \"We all decided that we wanted to do something different. We'd been on the same schedule for years: write a record, record a record, wait for the record to come out, then tour on it until we wanted to start the cycle again. We also wanted to break our own patterns and do something that was going to be inspiring and new for us.\"\n\nAttonito adds \"I remember being in New Zealand and saying we should do a release that doesn't come out all at once…I was thinking in the context of a TV series. Somebody else might have come up with the first of the month idea but usually all the creative stuff we do is a process. Everybody kind of throws a stick on the fire at the right time in the collaboration.\"\n\nDoing it for the sake of the music, the fans, and their own inspiration for twenty years, the group – and their White Castle – are going pedal to the metal on a full tank of gas. According to their frontman, \"The shared driving force is part of the mechanics that keeps the beast truckin' down the next highway. We were - and still are - a few passionate, rebellious, creative, idealistic, party loving punks looking for a good time, for something to believe in, and for something meaningful to live for.\"\n\nWith twenty years behind these legends from the Garden State, there's a lot more still to come from The B.S. – and that's no bull.",

  "artistSummary": "Acclaimed North Carolina-based band ’s new album, Blindfaller, is out today via Yep Roc Records. The record premiered on The Wall Street Journal and you can read their full interview HERE. No Depression raves, “The voices of Andrew Marlin and Emily Frantz were seemingly destined to make music and beautiful sounds together in harmony…the music they make is nothing short of perfection.” Their single, “Hard Travelin’,” previously premiered via PopMatters, who called the track, “a delightful mix of Americana, bluegrass and country. The new release builds on the acclaim of the band’s breakthrough Yep Roc debut, This Side of Jordan (2013), and last year’s Such Jubilee (2015). The band also begins their extensive full-band fall tour in San Francisco today with stops in Los Angeles, Seattle, Nashville, Chicago, New York and more. See below for tour itinerary with support on select dates from Leif Vollebekk, Anna Tivel, Dead Horses and My Bubba. While staying true to their Americana sound, the new album tackles modern day themes seen in our daily headlines. The North Carolina duo—comprised of Emily Frantz (fiddle/vocals) and Andrew Marlin (mandolin/vocals)—recorded the album in a one week break from touring at Rubber Room Studio in Chapel Hill, NC. “We wanted different vibes and different intuitions on these tracks,” Marlin says, “and I feel like we really captured that.” To bolster their message and sound on Blindfaller the duo added a full band, which features Clint Mullican on bass, Kyle Keegan on drums, Allyn Love on pedal steel, and previous collaborator, Josh Oliver, on guitar, keys, and vocals. Speaking to their recording process Frantz notes, “We talked about the feel of each song and pointed out loosely who was going to be taking solos, but it was mostly a lot of fresh takes, a lot of eye contact and a lot of nods and weird winks.” Founded in 2009, Mandolin Orange has built a noteworthy catalog of recordings. The band’s 2013 release This Side of Jordan garnered critical acclaim such as NPR, who called the album “effortless and beautiful,” and American Songwriter, who said it was “honest music, shot through with coed harmonies, sweeping fiddle, mandolin, acoustic guitar and the sort of unfakeable intimacy that bonds simpatico musicians like Gillian Welch and David Rawlings.” Their 2015 follow-up, Such Jubilee, furthered their standing with inclusion in Rolling Stone’s “30 Great Country Albums of 2015 You Probably Didn’t Hear,” NPR’s Folk Alley’s “Best of 2015 Listener’s Poll,” and Amazon’s “Best of the Next 2015.” The record was #1 on Magnet’s “Top 10 Indie Roots Albums of 2015” and Paste called it “an album full of blissful moments.” On the road, the band has built a dedicated following with extensive touring including appearances at Austin City Limits Festival, Telluride Bluegrass Festival, Newport Folk Festival, and Pickathon. The duo is currently performing select dates this summer before the start of their full-band tour. less…",

  "artistSummary": "No matter how brightly the sun shines, sorrow will always cast its ageless shadow across the human soul. Expressing that eternal sadness is an art in itself, and over the last two decades, Sweden’s masters of melancholy  have firmly established themselves as the most passionate and skilful exponents of the form. Formed by vocalist/drummer Jonas Renkse and guitarist Anders Nyström in Stockholm in 1991, the band emerged from the amorphous maelstrom that was the nascent death/doom metal scene; a darker, more emotionally resonant sibling to the ongoing extreme metal world, and one that offered a new and more humane perspective on life’s darker days. The band’s first releases, the Jhva Elohim Meth…The Revival EP and debut album Dance Of December Souls may have seemed to draw from the same set of influences that inspired like-minded bands across the North Sea like Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride, but by the time Katatonia arrived at 1996’s Brave Murder Day (which featured guest vocals from Opeth’s Mikael Åkerfeldt), the band had already begun to plough their own tearful furrow. “Initially we had no masterplan,” says Renkse today. “All we wanted was a band of our own, as we were totally devoured by the death and doom metal scene that was happening. It wasn’t until later that we could actually carve out our own space and see things with a broader perspective. Katatonia has become a philosophy, at least for ourselves, since it is pretty much all we have. It’s dark and personal music and lyrics, no matter what the environment around us.” In 1998, Katatonia released Discouraged Ones, an album that saw them step away from more traditional doom-laden atmospheres into an increasingly distinctive sonic world. Incorporating a wide variety of influences, from gothic rock to dark folk, the band’s evolution was gathering pace and their songwriting was maturing accordingly. With Jonas Renkse stepping away from the drum stool to focus on his role as vocalist, the Katatonia sound became more focused and intense on 1999’s Tonight’s Decision; a bravura collection of downbeat hymns to the void that set the tone for the new decade that followed. “Most of our evolution has occurred naturally,” explains Renkse. “We started as Paradise Lost fanboys, but now I think we have a different sound, something we have crafted over the years. With every new album we try to push the boundaries of songwriting and expand the concept of Katatonia without abandoning our foundation and roots.” As the 21st century has progressed, Katatonia have become one of the most revered and cherished of all bands in the modern heavy music firmament. Through extensive touring and a steady stream of superlative studio releases, including 2001’s classic Last Fair Deal Gone Down and its coruscating 2003 follow-up Viva Emptiness, the Swedes have spread their baleful gospel across the globe, refining and redefining themselves with every step into new territory. With 2006’s The Great Cold Distance and, in particular, 2009’s universally acclaimed Night Is The New Day, Katatonia have stretched beyond their roots in the metal scene and drawn in fans from all across the musical spectrum, not least in the progressive rock realm that has also embraced peers like Opeth and Anathema in recent times. In August 2012 the band released Dead End Kings, their ninth studio album and their most successful to date. The album marked another step in this journey towards a more progressive sound. Dead End Kings was recorded with a new line-up, in which Renkse and Nyström were joined by guitarist Per Eriksson, bassist Niklas Sandin and drummer Daniel Liljekvist. Together they created a rich, adventurous and endlessly evocative masterwork that exhibits all the Swedish quintet’s established traits while absorbing countless fresh ideas into that monumental sonic brew. “Dead End Kings represents progression and taking things to the next level,” concludes Renkse. ”The writing was a little more intense and spontaneous for this one. I think that’s the biggest difference. But it was made with the same mindset as the last few albums. It just had a little more fire involved. We don’t want to repeat ourselves. We are still hungry for new music.” The band return in September 2013 with Dethroned and Uncrowned, their first album for Kscope, the sister label to Peaceville, the band's home for the past 14 years. Dethroned and Uncrowned allows them to explore the progressive elements of Dead End Kings further as they have reworked the album, creating new moods and textures while still staying truthful to the core of the songs. Guitarist and founding member Anders Nyström explains how the band have revisted the album, ‘the synopsis is simple and album title won’t lie; the drums will be dethroned and the distorted rhythm guitars will be uncrowned! Instead, we’ll place the emphasis on the many layers of ambience, with the melodies staying central and the vocal harmonies representing the heart of the album.' less…",

With their debut “The Morning Never Came” Swallow the Sun got chosen the newcomer of the year in Inferno Magazine and received a full 5 K's review in Kerrang! the album was quoted as “One of the doom metals finest moments to date”. 2nd album “Ghosts of loss” climbed to #8 on Finnish album charts. This rare occasion, together with heavy touring both in Finland and abroad laid the groundwork for Swallow the Sun's skyrocketing success. In September 2006 Swallow the Sun recorded “Hope”, which was released in January of 2007 and impressively hit position #3 on the Official Finnish Album Chart, a feat never before achieved anywhere in the world with a doom album. A year after Swallow the Sun recorded ambitiously “Plague of Butterflies” –EP, which was released by Spinefarm Records in Europe, “Plague of Butterflies” crashed into the Number 1 spot on the Finnish charts in its first week. The EP was released in the US on September 23rd, and was followed by an extensive Finnish and American tour in early 2009.",

They both singed up for a talent show at their local homeschool group with some of their mutual friends and threw together a band called “The Hot List”. After the talent show, the band decided to play covers together for fun. As they got older, Phinehas and Byron started writing original songs together. With the maturity, writing originals became more than just an after school hobby. As things became more serious, the line up changed with it. After a few years of gigging, the band was discovered by Richard Segovia who took them under his wing. After some more line up changes, Phinehas and Byron decided to turn the band into a duo. Currently the two are releasing their debut EP on October 23rd. Phinehas and Byron’s Influences range from various artists such as Kings of Leon, Young the Giant, Bad Suns, The Strokes, Hiatus Kaiyote, John Mayer and many more.",

Songs followed in 2002 and Soviet Kitsch in 2004.",

  "artistSummary": "RADIOHEAD are an English rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, formed in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of the band's debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's style, as they incorporated influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Despite initially dividing fans and critics, Kid A was later named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was the band's final album for their record label, EMI; their subsequent releases have been self-released. Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. Their ninth album is expected in 2016. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.",

The tour announces on the heels of Legend’s fifth studio album Darkness and Light, which has received a plethora of critical praise since its December 2nd release on Columbia Records. USA Today hailed the album as John’s “most personal record” with tracks like “Right By You” which they described as “a heart –tugging rumination on his 7-month old daughter, Luna.” Time Magazine called the body of work “unflappably classy” while the New York Times said Legend “treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match.” Continuing, the New York Times pointed to the album’s most recent anthemic hit single, “Love Me Now”, which they praised as “a seize the moment song”, that “revolves around an insistent, lo-fi piano figure, and its chorus first arrives with Mr. Legend nearly alone, singing over simple, fading chords”.\nLegend also continues his successful foray into the world of film as one of the principles for production company Get Lifted Film Co., which has an executive producing credit on the 14-time Oscar-nominated film La La Land in which John also appears, playing a jazz band leader named Keith alongside stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Legend also contributed to the film’s soundtrack with the original song “Start a Fire.” To date, La La Land has taken home an impressive six Golden Globe Awards, two SAG Awards and a PGA Award.",

  "artistSummary": "Since 1997, San Francisco’s  have recorded four best-selling albums and assembled one career retrospective. 3EB recently released “We Are Drugs. “ Led by Stephan Jenkins, 3EB won wide success during a tumultuous group of years when the major-label recording industry was finally losing its grip on an enterprise that for decades it had dominated with steely efficiency. Nothing could have made 3EB happier! 3EB, however, have experienced no comparable loss. Instead, they have gained artistic clarification — and, surprisingly, a fan base who is larger, younger and more dedicated than ever. Participation in the older, untouchable realm of nervous star-making could color a band’s identity. In the case of 3EB, it often blurred the perception of their brilliant musical creations. In recent years, those creations have recast the band among a current generation of fans. 3EB now write, tour, record, and communicate in a fluid new world where their music continues naturally to evolve. Their exchange with their audience is unfiltered and being from the hub of tech, they are using it to develop a closer exchange with their audience. After a stunning festival run in 2016 with appearances at Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Bumbershoot, Bonnaroo and many others, they are poised for a fantastic 20th Anniversary celebration in 2017 with new material to be released.",

The track premiered today on Rollingstone.com. The highly anticipated new material accompanies the film, The Smog Of The Sea, a documentary that provides a new perspective on the once pristine oceans of the world, while making an artful call to action for rethinking single-use plastic. The Smog Of The Sea is available to stream starting today via, www.smogofthesea.com.\nCurbing the use of single-use plastic has been at the forefront of Johnson’s work for over a decade. Since 2005, Johnson’s crew has implemented a plastic free backstage and since 2007 all shows have offered fans free water through water-refill stations. In 2014, Johnson successfully helped launch a Reusable Pint Program at the Santa Barbara Bowl, which has since inspired venues across the country to follow suit, including the Les Schwab Amphitheatre in Bend, OR, and all venues owned by Live Nation. This summer, more venues will adopt a Reusable Pint Program, which provides fans with an alternative to disposable plastic cups. Fans who purchase this reusable stainless steel cup at venue concessions will receive a discount on all beverage refill purchases for the life of the cup.\nIn addition to these plastic free initiatives, Johnson and his production team, alongside Reverb, will continue to pave the way in green touring practices with extensive sustainability programs at every show. On the 2017 tour, additional greening actions include sourcing sustainable biodiesel for tour vehicles, producing up-cycled and eco-friendly merchandise, and expanding waste reduction, composting and recycling. The tour will also source local, organic food as part of a “farm to stage” program, offer bike valets and alternative transportation incentives, as well as offset all remaining CO2 emissions. Through Johnson’s All At Once campaign, the summer tour will support over 140 non-profit partners and will engage fans to take action in support of sustainable local food systems and plastic free initiatives. Fans can visit these partners in the Village Green and participate in the greening actions at each show and win a chance to watch Johnson’s set from the Best Seats in the House….the stage!

There’s a bittersweet, romantic sensibility present. The overall feeling is lost love, or perhaps love never found, yet Mac embraces this without making it an overly somber experience for the listener. It’s at times haunting and warm, and a bit more refined and sophisticated, but still plenty playful, retaining the guts and soul of classic Mac.",

And what is a wake but a celebration-a toast of appreciation-an expression of love-and a damn good party?\n\nSo when seven top Bay Area musicians realized they shared as deep a love for the songs of the Grateful Dead as they did for traditional Celtic tunes, some brand-new music sprang up and started partying. \nWAKE THE DEAD is a romp that flows seamlessly from rock grooves to hot Irish reels, and from haunting airs to achingly beautiful melodies familiar to Deadheads everywhere. “Sugaree” in waltz time, bracketed by an ancient harp tune and infused with a poignant Celtic longing. “Bertha” thundering out of “China Cat” on a mandolin tidal wave. The eerie lilt of the uilleann pipes, giving a glow to “Bird Song” as if it was always meant to be there. Groove jams to keep the tie-dye swirling. Vocal harmonies that float like clouds. The music takes off, and the band follows, grinning all the way. These aren’t worlds colliding-they’re worlds meshing, coalescing­ creating a whole new world of possibility, and true to the spirits of the Grateful Dead and the eternally hopeful Celts. \nWAKE THE DEAD bands together seven of the best-known and most respected players in the west. Harper Maureen Brennan has toured for over 30 years and recorded the acclaimed “Harpistry” collection. Bassist Cindy Browne is equally at home in folk and jazz, touring globally as the musical fusion go-to gal. Singer, fiddler, and octave mandolinist Danny Carnahan is an award-winning songwriter whose original Irish-tinged songs are popular worldwide. Kevin Carr is a musical triple-threat, renowned as a dance fiddler, a pennywhistler, and Irish piper par excellence. Sylvia Herold’s delicious vocal phrasing can also be heard on her solo recordings and her performances with Euphonia. Paul Kotapish is known far and wide for his work with Kevin Burke’s Open House, and for his blazing guitar and mandolin with The Hillbillies From Mars and Euphonia. And Latin percussionist Brian Rice rounds out the band’s groove engine.",

Portland Metronome puts the quintet “at the forefront of a youthful generation trying to redefine what string music is and what it can do.”\n\nThat progressive nature shines through in the band’s latest album, Washoe (February 26). A 12-song collection of original songs by Dead Winter Carpenter members, Washoe’s diverse track list pays tribute to diverse musical influences including classic rock, bluegrass, alt-country, and rockabilly. Highlight tracks include “Midnight Ghost,” “Love Amongst Thieves,” and “Winning Hand,” and the angst-tinged duet, “If I Wrote You A Song.” \nThe five-piece outfit is:\n\n-fiddler/vocalist – Jenni Charles\n\n-upright bassist/vocalist – Dave Lockhart\n\n-guitarist/vocalist – Jesse Dunn\n\n-guitarist/vocalist – Bryan Daines\n\n-drummer/vocalist – Brian Huston \nThe Last Revel\nFrom the budding music scene of the Upper Midwest comes the cutting edge Front Porch Americana soundscapes of The Last Revel. This powerfully talented trio of multi-instrumentalists from Minneapolis, Minnesota so naturally blends the genres of Folk, Rockabilly, Old Time String-Band and Rock to create a sound that is as equally original as it is timeless. \nThe Last Revel trio utilizes their multi-instrumental abilities to bring the acoustic guitar, upright bass, fiddle, 5-string banjo, harmonica, kick drum and three-part vocal harmonies together to consistently deliver “Bombastic live performances,” as well as delicate and haunting folk ballads. \nWith their second, self titled, album released in May of 2015, The Last Revel further demonstrates their ability to create rich and delicately textured recorded material with a modern “tip of the hat” to the storied history of American folk music.",

He was guitarist, songwriter and frontman Progressive Rock Powerhouse King Crimson for over 30 years. \"Discipline\", Adrian's first record with King Crimson, is listed among the most important rock records ever made.\n\nBelew has had a career that commands both awe and respect from fellow musicians and loyal fans, from his first solo record \"The Lone Rhino\" to The Atlantic Records hit album \"Mr. Music Head\" or any of his other 20 solo records that push sonic boundaries while maintaining artistic integrity. Adrian shreds on guitar but also writes beautiful songs that will make you cry. Yes, Adrian has taken his fans on a wild ride through countless world tours and albums with David Bowie, Talking Heads, Laurie Anderson, NIN and Paul Simon. He truly is the Twang Bar King!\n\nMeanwhile, Belew continues work on the latest additions to his FLUX project, including an album called FLUXbybelew and an in-app addition entitled FLUXation. FLUX is 'music which is never the same twice'. To accommodate the original concept FLUX was released on iTunes as a music app for iPhone and iPad (the only one of its kind, available on iTunes at bit.ly/FLUX_cd) with the app downloaded, you press Play to activate 30 minutes of music, songs, sounds, and visuals which will never happen again in quite the same way. that's because of some very clever algorithms and a huge amount of content.",

  "artistSummary": "Jackie Greene\n\"We live in such a fast-paced, hectic environment, I wanted to make a record that would invite people to step back and take their time to listen,\" Jackie Greene says of Back to Birth, his first album in five years. \"I wanted to make a record that would reward people who are willing to sit down and give it a couple of serious listens.\"\n\nBack to Birth - Greene's seventh album and his Yep Roc Records debut - is more than worthy of some serious attention. The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me. We know each other well enough at this point that we can be blunt with each other, and he'll tell me that I'm full of it if that's what I need to hear.\"\n\nThe musical passion and creative integrity that drive Back to Birth have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. While growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Hot on the heels of the 2015 album release The Outsider, the full-length documentary Island Bound, and an extensive tour schedule, Isle of Man-born Davy Knowles announces his new album Three Miles From Avalon. This collection of new songs sees Davy returning to his roots, and the sounds that first ignited his passion for music.\n\nRecorded exclusively in his adopted hometown of Chicago, the capital of electric blues provided Knowles with a landscape steeped in legend, inspiring him to creatively explore the genre of music he's always loved – energetic, guitar driven blues-rock.\n\nKnowles began the recording process for Three Miles From Avalon with a fresh approach, one that has resulted in a dynamic, gutsy sound: \"I wanted to go back to the basics. The band and myself have racked up a lot of playing time together, and we have really started to gel. I wanted to capture that 'live' feel in the studio\n\nThis led naturally to a back-to-basics approach, and a search for authenticity when it came to recording the new material: \"My favourite sounding records are certainly older ones, recorded to tape, with minimal fuss or overdubs. I wanted that lovely warm, vintage sound that only tape and glowing tubes can do.\"\n\nA raw, vintage sound is evident in the album's opening two tracks, the hard-driving Ain't Much Of Nothing, and a long-time live favourite, What You're Made Of, a homage to one of Davy's musical heroes: \"Rory Gallagher has been a huge influence for me, his energy and drive was so mesmerising. I wanted to get back to that high energy, big guitar riff style of writing.\"\n\nFalling Apart, the album's third track, adds dark drama to the record's driving pace with its smoky verses and heavy, snarling, blues riff. \"I've had this song kicking around for a long time, but it wasn't until I had found this guitar pedal called 'The Octron' (one of only two pedals used by Knowles on the entire album) that the song and the riff really came to life, it's got this wonderful menacing sound.\"\n\nWeaving a moment of pathos into the tracklist is Oxford MS – a fictional account of shady dealing and violence. Storytelling has always been a vital ingredient in Knowles' work: \"Songs with characters and stories have always grabbed me, and I wanted to write one in the blues and gospel vein, it's a story of blackmail, gambling and regret, though certainly not an autobiographical one!\"\n\nYet it's the title track, Three Miles From Avalon, which brings to the fore very personal aspects to a tale. \"The song is really all about being slightly further away than where you want to be, and the frustration that comes with that. Avalon is this Arthurian legend, the Island that could never be found. It became my metaphor for things just out of my grasp.\"\n\nThe song also reveals the musical influences close to Davy's heart, showcasing his love of blues and classic rock with affection\n\nThe album closes on a hat tip to one of the all-time greats, Willie Dixon, with a re-working of his blues classic What In The World. Performed with a live, 'after hours' feel, the track showcases Knowles' confident and distinctive guitar playing, but also a powerful solo on the Hammond B3 by Andrew Toombs – demonstrating that Knowles and his tight-knit band all possess not only stunning technical ability, but soul too.",

The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me.

His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Jerry Joseph\nFor more than 30 years, Jerry Joseph has been strapping on a guitar and chasing down truth, understanding and soul with a tenacity and resonant skill that mark him as a hard charging kindred spirit to Joe Strummer, Warren Zevon and Patti Smith. While not a household name or critic's darling, Joseph is the archetypal musician's musician, something resoundingly clear in his live performances, as well as his studio work. \n\nJoseph's current foursome, the Jackmormons, is the latest chapter in his long, strange musical journey that flows like glowing quicksilver through the modern psyche, where war and disaster wrestle with hope and faith. The Jackmormons currently feature Joseph (guitar, lead vocals), Steve Drizos (drums, backing vocals), Steve James Wright (bass, backing vocals) and Jeff Crosby (guitar, vocals). \n\nJoseph first came to prominence in the mid-1980s with still-beloved cult band Little Women, a reggae-rock proto-jam band that dominated the Rocky Mountain club scene for nearly a decade, and notably helped break jam giants Widespread Panic, who looked up to Joseph and opened for his band before rising to prominence. In fact, Joseph wrote many of Panic's favorite concert staples, including such blazing epics as North, Chainsaw City and Climb to Safety. \n\nSteve Drizos and Steve James Wright are also musical lifers working steadily for decades both as sparring partners to Jerry Joseph and elsewhere. Drizos was a member of acoustic Dexter Grove from 1995-2004, a band that performed over 1,500 shows nationally. Drizos produced the live Jackmormons record Badlandia and co-produced Happy Book, as well as performing and recording with such luminaries as Dave Mason and Jim Capaldi (of Traffic), Widespread Panic, The Decemberists, moe., Merle Saunders, Eric McFadden, and dozens of local Portland artists. \n\nSteve James Wright has been a complement to Joseph since almost Day One, as the guitarist for Little Women and an outstanding player in his own right. After taking some time off, James graciously and expertly moved over to bass to bring back a slinkier, funkier and more psychedelic mood to the Jackmormons sound. His deep knowledge of the material and his more melodic style now combine to challenge the band to find its finest grooves.\n\nThe more recent addition of young stud guitar player/singer/songwriter Jeff Crosby (Jeff Crosby & The Refugees) has proved another prescient move by Joseph. A couple of Crosby’s songs from the 2013 album, Silent Conversations, were featured on the hit FX series, Sons of Anarchy. Crosby helps brings out the Americana sensibility of the Jackmormons sound, and his crisp guitar work proves an admirable counterpart to Joseph’s open-minded approach. And a Crosby tune or 2 has become a welcome part of a Jackmormons’ set.\n\nJoseph’s influences are many and varied. “Columbia Record Club used to have 20 records for a penny and I filled out form after form, and these boxes of records came to my house and my parents would flip out. Those were my influences,” says Joseph. “I was a kid, so I was as into The Monkees as I was The Beatles. Then, my mother would tell you, it was all over on my 9th or 10th birthday with [Black Sabbath's] Master of Reality and Steppenwolf Live. Then at 12, it was jazz. I saw every jazz act that toured in the 70s…Herbie Hancock and Tower of Power after we went to see Steely Dan. All that and then my older babysitter bought me Exile on Main Street and I saw [Bob Marley and] The Wailers in 1976 and moved to New Zealand. And then The Clash came out and changed my life. But I also loved ZZ Top and all those guitar bands. When I lived in New Zealand, I sat in my window and read Lord of the Rings while listening to prog like Gentle Giant and Camel. Later, I learned a lot from Chris Whitley touring around Europe with him.”\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph is steadily extending his global reach, taking advantage of the Internet's ability to find audiences worldwide with tours in Southeast Asia, Europe, Central America, Israel, Lebanon, Ireland, England and elsewhere. Joseph is a hyper-gifted American singer-songwriter finding appreciation beyond his own country's borders, an endlessly insightful rabble-rouser and back street shaman. His creative tendrils extend beyond the Jackmormons into everything from extensive solo work to rangy rock juggernaut Stockholm Syndrome (where Joseph plays with Widespread Panic's Dave Schools, Bay Area guitar marvel Eric McFadden, Gov't Mule's Danny Louis, and percussionist Wally Ingram), and a host of unreleased work.\n\nDespite the sort of roadblocks and turns of fortune that usually crush most musicians, Joseph survives, and in fact, thrives in a way that's heartening and stirring, as anyone who has seen a live show can testify.\n\n“I'm lucky. I work. I've never had to play in a cover band. I've never had to wear a funny hat, “ says Joseph. “Perhaps because of the lack of traditional success, I've put out about a record a year, plus all the stuff that's never come out, and it's kept me creatively honest. I don't rehash my past. I don't repeat any of my old hits because I don't have any big hits.”",

  "artistSummary": "Since moving to Los Angeles from her native Guatemala, singer-songwriter Gaby Moreno has achieved remarkable success as a musician. She has been nominated for an Emmy and won a Latin Grammy for Best New Artist. She has released four albums, toured with singers Tracy Chapman, Ani DiFranco, Punch Brothers, Hugh Laurie and Calexico, and has shared the international stage with pop music luminaries such as Bono, Andrea Boccelli and Van Dyke Parks.\n\nIn 2006, her song, “Escondidos,” took the top prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest, the first contestant in the Latin category to win Song of the Year. (She’s now a judge.) That opened many more doors. Her first album, “Still the Unknown” , produced independently was released in 2008.\n\nMoreno’s career started moving quickly. She co-wrote the theme song of the television series “Parks and Recreation,” which was nominated for an Emmy in 2010. That same year, she recorded the classic song “Smile,” by Charlie Chaplin, for the Oscar-winning documentary “The Cove.” And she performed “Toast to Freedom,” a song commemorating the 50th anniversary of Amnesty International, first with Kris Kristofferson on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, then in Dublin where she shared the stage with Angelique Kidjo and Bono.\n\nShe released her second album, “Illustrated Songs” in 2011, followed by “Postales.” in 2012, her first release entirely in Spanish and with Metamorfosis, the label founded by her compatriot Ricardo Arjona, one of Latin America’s most prominent singer-songwriters. . That year, Moreno and Arjona released a duet, “Fuiste Tu,” which was nominated for Song of the Year and Record of the Year in the 13th Annual Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nBy the time Moreno was named Best New Artist in the 14th annual Latin Grammy Awards of 2013, the “newcomer” had already almost spent half her life in the music business.\n\nWhen it came time to record her latest album, “Ilusión” (due for release September 9th), Moreno decided it was time to harken back to beginnings. Musically, the new album captures the pure spirit of the aspiring immigrant artist who made her way in a new country with just her guitar, her gifted voice, and a pocketful of songs she was eager to share.\n\n“I wanted the record to sound as authentic and as close as possible to what the band sounds live,” she says, referring to her longtime collaborators. “I said, ‘Okay, let’s go back to the sound when I put out my first album, when it was just a few musicians in a room together, and it was about having fun and capturing performances. I wanted something human. I’m not a robot. I wanted to embrace the imperfections. That’s human. Maybe in the moment, I’m feeling something that’s making my voice break. It’s raw emotion. I wanted to keep that.\"\n\nAnd she succeeded. The new collection of 13 songs, most of which she wrote or co-wrote, reflect the organic mixture of her wide array of influences, from the blues to boleros. The record’s natural sound reflects the analog philosophy of producer Gabe Roth, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Daptone Records, the independent label specializing in what it calls the “New Sound of Old Soul.”\n\nThat’s a slogan that happens to suit the singer to a tee. \n\n“I don’t want to sound like an old record, but there’s something about those old records that I love, especially that warm sound,” says Moreno. “This is why I wanted to go into the studio for this new record with Gabe Roth. Because of his minimalist approach. He doesn’t use any computers, it’s all his ears. We did it all to tape, using these beautiful old vintage microphones, and playing all together in the same room. So you don’t have the luxury of doing 20 takes for every song. We do three takes and choose the best one out of the three. It was kind of nerve-racking... but it sounds so real.”\n\nThe album includes separate Spanish and English versions of the first single, “Se Apagó/Love Is Gone,” a song of heartbreak with a twangy guitar, a bright brass section and a feel of Southern soul. Nashville-based R&B singer Jonny P joins her on their English duet, a couple’s dialog.\n\nMoreno’s uplifting, hymn-like “Fronteras,” which means borders, reveals a theme of hope in the midst of darkness. In a time of persecution of immigrants, the song extends a hand of camaraderie for those who leave everything behind to pursue their dreams. The bilingual refrain captures the essence of “Ilusión” and the composer’s confident, mature state of mind when she created it: “And I laugh and dance. It’s in my blood. And I dream free. This is where I belong.”",

  "artistSummary": "Leo Nocentelli\nLeo Nocentelli was one of the original members of the Meters, a groundbreaking funk group based in New Orleans from the mid-'60s to the mid-'70s. The band, playing mostly instrumentals, stayed at the forefront of the music scene in the Big Easy and achieved a good measure of national attention with Nocentelli penning songs and contributing guitar work. He has since gone out on his own developing his style with varied elements that span blues, rock, rap, jazz, and funk, but he considers himself a funk musician, first and foremost. He and his band have performed from coast to coast across the U.S., including an appearance at New Orleans' Jazz & Heritage Festival. He has penned more than 200 songs, some of which were recorded by Robert Palmer, Joe Cocker, Etta James, the Neville Brothers, Z.Z. Hill, Albert King, and George Duke.\n\nDespite his desire to be known as a funk guitarist, Nocentelli originally wanted to be a jazz musician. He taught himself how to play the guitar during his youth by holing up in his room and listening to recordings by such artists as Charlie Christian, Barney Kessel, Johnny Smith, and Kenny Burrell. He found work with Danny White, and followed up with a stint as part of Art Neville & the Hawkettes. The Hawkettes eventually evolved into the Meters, whose membership included George Porter Jr. and Joseph \"Ziggy\" Modeliste. Nocentelli's career includes session work for a number of artists, including Peter Gabriel, Earl King, Dr. John, Lee Dorsey, and Patti LaBelle, as well as the Wild Tchoupitoulas, an offshoot of the Meters. He has also played on recordings by Manhattan Transfer, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, the Supremes, Bonnie Raitt, Sting, and the Winans, among others.\n\nNocentelli's first release, Live in San Francisco from DJM Records, came about almost by chance. He hadn't intended to put together a live recording when he played one night at a club called Slim's, but went about his business on stage and gave a good show to his loyal following. When the night wound down, a man from the audience approached him and gave the funk musician a tape that he'd made that night with a DAT recorder. A few years later, the guitarist pulled the tape out of storage and asked a friend to copy it onto a cassette. While the music was playing in Nocentelli's friend's studio, DJM Records chief Daniel Moore stopped by. Nocentelli's music caught his ear, and he agreed to put out a CD.\n\nThe guitarist played with an incarnation of the Meters, called the Funky Meters, until 1993, when he decided to go solo. He has also contributed to movie soundtracks, among them White Men Can't Jump, Blaze, and Heartbreakers. His television appearances include An Evening at the Improv and Saturday Night Live. The Louisiana native resides in Los Angeles, CA.",

Honest and well crafted, these songs reflect deeply personal stories, yet remain universally relatable. \n\nOlivia was born and raised in the Bay Area, and was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was one year old. Her struggle with the disease has provided an inspiration for her song writing, and she explores themes such as claiming one's identity and celebrating the preciousness of life. She has been faced with difficult challenges and life-and-death realities at an unusually young age, and these experiences add depth and wisdom to her lyrics. Her music resonates with hopeful optimism, and her story is an inspiration.",

  "artistSummary": "Gaelynn Lea All the Roads that Lead Us Home & The Songs We Sing Along the Way\n\nGaelynn Lea is a musician from Duluth, MN. She has been playing violin for over twenty years. First classically trained, she began learning traditional Celtic and American fiddle tunes at the age of 18. During her college years Gaelynn started sitting in with various folk/rock musicians and developed an improvisational style all her own. Eventually she also began singing and dabbling in songwriting. Gaelynn has played alongside many notable Minnesota musicians over the years, including Alan Sparhawk, Charlie Parr, and Billy McLaughlin. \n\nGaelynn Lea has been actively performing throughout Northern Minnesota and Wisconsin since 2006, contributing to a number of musical projects in the Twin Ports. Currently her most active collaboration is The Murder of Crows, an atmospheric alternative duo with Alan Sparhawk. Together they recorded an EP titled \"Imperfecta\" in 2012. Their original song \"When We Were Young\" was featured on the Sundance Channel's acclaimed drama \"Rectify\" in June 2014. Gaelynn also regularly performs solo sets of experimental fiddle tunes sprinkled with her original songs; her aim is to create a meditative, layered sound that allows the listener's mind to drift. \n\nIn November 2015, Gaelynn Lea released her debut solo album entitled \"All the Roads that Lead Us Home\". It pays homage to the traditional fiddle tunes and beloved standards that Gaelynn has been playing for over a decade… But of course, there is a twist! Gaelynn used her Memory Man looping pedal to create winding layers of sound underneath these familiar melodies. \n\nFrom her album review by Tony Bennett in the Duluth News Tribune: \n\n\"Lea takes a meditative approach, building loops that are based on sustained notes and vibrato, loops that seem like she's scoring a sunrise on a winter morning. Yearning, reaching melodies emerge from the wash of sound and then recede into the background. Chords are flittingly outlined as root notes collide with thirds or fifths or sevenths. It's all very ephemeral and gauzy, and the tracks are easy to get lost in. All the Roads that Lead Us Home is a focused, vibrant piece of music by a person who is able to take a solitary instrument and make it sound like a full string arrangement, who can fill a full-length LP with mostly just those sounds and communicate fluently her heart and soul with only a few tools.\" \n\nOn March 3, 2016, Gaelynn Lea was named the winner of NPR Music's second-ever Tiny Desk Contest. Her music video entry rose to the top of over 6,100 entries from around the nation, chosen as the unanimous favorite among the contest's six judges. The very next week, Gaelynn performed a moving Tiny Desk Concert, at which the show's host Bob Boilen said \"there was hardly a dry eye.\" \n\nA handful of busy months flew by after winning NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest, and somewhere in that whirlwind Gaelynn managed to record a 6-track EP titled \"The Songs \n\nWe Sing Along the Way\". This record was released on August 15th, 2016 and is a blend of Lea's original songs (including the contest-winning number, \"Someday We'll Linger in the Sun\"), traditional fiddle tunes, and her own poetry. \n\nLea identifies equally as a songwriter and a fiddler, so much like her debut solo album, Gaelynn constructed this EP to be a winding exploration of both art forms. However this time around she took a slightly different approach, choosing to collaborate with Minneapolis songwriter, guitarist and percussionist Alan Church (BBGUN, Al Church and State). He skillfully added texture and color to each track as they improvised together in The Pearl Recording Studio in the Twin Cities. Gaelynn Lea hopes this EP will provide her new, wider audience with a sense hope and an appreciation of what the violin can do and has done for hundreds of years. \n\nIn addition to performing and recording, Gaelynn loves to do speaking engagements about disability, overcoming challenges, and the joy of music. Gaelynn has a congenital disability called Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or Brittle Bones Disease. In recent years, she has used her music as a platform to advocate for people with disabilities and to promote positive social change. Gaelynn believes society must make accessibility a priority so people with disabilities can participate fully in their communities and use their talents and gifts without discrimination. \n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Karen Dalton and Joanna Newsom melt together in the form of Gaelynn Lea and set about absolutely obliterating your heart.\" -Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys)\n\n\"The way her voice resonates is so unusual and beautiful, like nothing I've ever heard before.\" -Jess Wolfe (Lucius)",

Fronted by the charismatic and soulful vocalist Mark Sexton - The Sextones’ sound is a tip of the hat to the days of Tower of Power and Stevie Wonder while actively forging the path for a new generation of soul and funk. Based in the wild desert of Reno, NV, The Sextones continue to diligently craft their distinctive brand of soul with face-melting guitar parts, intricate bass-work, commanding drum rhythms, sticky Hammond B3 comping, brutally honest and heartfelt vocal acrobatics and a fearless and exciting stage performance.In 2014 the original trio of Mark Sexton, bassist Alexander Korostinsky and drummer Daniel Weiss employed the talents of keyboard virtuoso Ryan Taylor to complete their musical family. Over the last 10 years, these young soul renegades have relentlessly toured the west coast gaining a multifarious group of loyal fans that help turn every show into an all-out funk dance party. The future has continued to get brighter for The Sextones as they have shared the stage with music heavyweights, Macy Gray, Charles Bradley, Dumpstaphunk, and their idols are starting to take notice. Festival appearances have included Railroad Earth’s Hangtown Halloween Ball, Wanderlust and Brews Jazz & Funk Fest just to name a few. The release of their debut album later in 2016 will include a national tour and more regional support tours.Formally known as Mark Sexton Band, their 2013 release, Young & Naïve, was mixed by none other than legendary drummer Alan Evans of Soulive. “It sounded great even before I got my hands on it”, explains Alan Evans, “that’s what happens when you get great players playing great songs.” The album was recorded in Los Angeles by Emmy Award winning engineer Larold Rebhun. The group’s new album \"Moonlight Vision\" was recorded at Prairie Sun Studios in Northern California and is set for release in April 20",

  "artistSummary": "Greetings, music lovers. Allow us to draw attention to the new slab by the emminent and hirsute Steeltown reprobate, Lee Harvey Osmond, aka Tom Wilson aka One of Three Rodeo Kings aka that large, melodic growling man from the former Junkhouse. This record is called “Beautiful Scars,” as in: “Man, that scar is beautiful,” or “She has a beautiful scar right here…” or “My scar is beautiful. It reminds me of that time I didn’t die.” The humanity of the album– produced by Michael Timmins in the intimacy of his Toronto Roncesvalles studio– is like the warmth of blood that rushes to the cut: a sudden jolt in the middle of peril and uncertainty; a suspension of possibility that anything can happen next. Redolent with swooning horns and guitars that bob and weave, LHO’s voice– forever the hallmark of his sound, which spans over three decades of work– sounds, here, like a warm hand to the forehead, an arm on the arm of the stricken, a comforting growl at the heart of a screaming world. At once evoking Howlin’ Wolf, Mike Scott and Roy Loney, “Beautiful Scars” bends and twists and stretches and squeezes LHO’s deep baritone, the producer treating it as if caged in a transistor radio, bathed in echo from above, or sunk in the muck of distortion. The strength of the songs notwithstanding, “Beautiful Scars” is a fascinating vocal journey to rank among the great sonic Canadian records of our time.\n\nThrough the truncheon swing of “Loser for your Love” to the haunting balladry of “Come and Go” to the morose beauty of “Burning in My Bed” to the exotic fusion of the album’s penultimate track, “Black Spruce,” “Beautiful Scars” journeys between the quiet, smouldering, raging, moving and sad. Lyrically, LHO reflects on the mistakes of the singer’s past with the resigned perspective of someone coming through the other side. A song like “Hey, Hey, Hey”– featuring a thrilling slide guitar piece by Aaron Goldstein– describes two lovers caught in the throes of personal despair, their “dreams turned to rust,” their lives waiting until “the morning comes and sweeps us both away.” LHO sings: “The world is fucked up. And so are you and I.” It defines an album, and a songwriter, bereft of any choices other than to keep moving for fear of sinking into the mire of a dark past.\n\nThis is the 3rd solo album from the Hamilton songwriter– the progenitor of “Acid Folk,”– whose previous two albums, “A Quiet Evil” and “The Folk Sinner” were previously long-listed for the Polaris Prize and nominated for a Juno. It’s a dynamic footprint on Canada’s song-scape, a deeply personal, but universally affecting, journey across the jagged line of scars and smoothness of skin that surrounds them.",

  "artistSummary": "Scott Capurro\nScott Capurro was reared in Daly City, California; at age 3, he swam the English Channel. Since 1993, he's avoided AIDS by telling unsavory jokes in every English speaking country. Scott is trusting and thus surrounded by duplicity, yet he continues challenging himself, because he's physically challenged and emotionally unstable.\n\nDescribed by San Francisco Weekly (free press, edited by lesbians and designed by trannys with large hands and hidden agendas) as \"stand-up in the very best possible sense - deadpan, ever-alert and hilarious\" Scott has appeared in Mrs. Doubtfire, where, effortlessly, he played a homosexual; and Star Wars: Phantom Menace, where, breathlessly, he wore a body stocking.\n\nScott knows David Cameron (wink, wink) and Nelson Mandela. Well, he's met Nelson once. They're both vegetarians. Actually, Scott is. Nelson said he was, to impress Scott. Cameron eats anything.",

  "artistSummary": "Tony Lucca\nHe was cast by Justin Timberlake to play “the cool guy” in Timberlake’s directorial debut.\n\nHe finished third on The Voice in 2012, won a record deal in the process, and received more press coverage than any contestant on the show that season… or any season, for that matter.\n\nHe made a record with Adam Levine, then toured with Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson.\n\nHe was cast on the hit show “Parenthood” playing himself as a rock singer, and performed an original song.\n\nHe even starred in an Aaron Spelling prime-time drama and dated Keri Russell for years, winding up in countless gossip mags.\n\nHis name is Tony Lucca.\n\nSo why isn’t he a household name? Maybe he simply hadn’t made the right record before.\n\nThis time, Lucca believes he has. It’s his 8th full-length studio album, his first self-titled release, and first entirely self-produced effort.\n\n“We went in with the intention of making a record that was as live-sounding as possible. I wanted to close my eyes and be able to visualize the players in the room or up on the stage, actually playing the songs together. One guitar over here, the other guy over there, bass, drums, some keys? I mean, that’s the rock-n-roll I fell in love with when I was a kid.” Lucca pulls inspiration from the heroes he heard on the radio growing up, from Tom Petty, Billy Squier to AC/DC’s Angus Young, tapping into a sense of timelessness he places somewhere between The Black Crowes and the Black Keys.\n\nEach of the 12 songs on “Tony Lucca” are deeply personal. The record kicks off with “Old Girl”, Lucca’s rebuff to the music business treadmill. On the upbeat “Imagination”, Lucca recalls the evening where he met his wife… to the best of his ability. Lucca’s fans will enjoy the diverse sonic quality of four of his trademark ballads – the epic and sweeping piano-driven “North Star”, the optimistic “Smoke ‘Em”, the push and pull of love lost and found in “Right On Time”, and the sweet album closer that bares his daughter’s name, “Sparrow”.\n\nFunded by a very successful Kickstarter campaign (one that hit its $25K funding goal just inside of 30 hours), Lucca feels strongly that his fans stepped up so that he could make the best record he possibly could – one he could finally feel comfortable releasing with his own name as the title. To that point, Lucca says “this record is pure. And honest. And hopefully completely refreshing to its listeners.”\n\nTony Lucca was born on the outskirts of Detroit on the heels of Motown’s heyday, raised within the loving confines of an enormous family of musicians; his mom was the 10th of 12 kids who all sang and played. At the ripe old age of 12, Tony had his first paying gig as a musician at a Jr. High School dance and by the age of 15, he parlayed his childhood rock-n-roll fantasy into a legitimate career, getting cast among an extraordinary group of newcomers on The All New Mickey Mouse Club, along with Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling and Britney Spears.\n\nShortly after graduating high school, Lucca wound up in LA and embarked upon an independent recording career that would span over 20 years. Along the way he’s toured with artists as colossal as Maroon 5, Kelly Clarkson, *NSYNC and Marc Anthony, as well as several of his fellow Hotel Cafe kin including Josh Kelley, Sara Bareilles, Joey Ryan (Milk Carton Kids), Gabe Dixon and Andrew Belle. Lucca won the LA Music Award for best male singer/songwriter in 2001 and appeared numerous times on Last Call with Carson Daly, as well as The Wayne Brady Show and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Also in 2013, Lucca was the sole entertainment for FOX’s NFL Thanksgiving Day telecast for the Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers game.",

  "artistSummary": "Go By Ocean\nIt has been said that “the darkest hour is just before the dawn,” and in the case of Ryan McCaffrey, leading member of San Francisco indie rock band Go By Ocean, that dark hour turned into several dark years.\n\nAs things currently stand, however, we’re somewhere around midday. The sun is at its highest and the singer/guitarist is embracing his new life in the light. On Go By Ocean’s second full length, McCaffrey and his troupe have harnessed its energy and the aptly titled Sun Machine radiates a message of hope and perseverance.\n\nFirst track Ring Around The Sun is symbolic of the year it took its creator’s eyes to adjust. A driving beat forms a solid backbone, over top of which McCaffrey grieves his past and sings his enthusiasm for the future. The song is a reminder that time is impermanent, a message which is matched by the track’s bright, upbeat vibe.",
