  "artistSummary": "\n                      Pure Bathing Culture\nTo hear Sarah Versprille and Daniel Hindman tell it, their Portland, OR-based band Pure Bathing Culture has always evolved naturally and at a steady pace. \"That's really the path we've been on as a band, always putting one foot in front of the other as opportunities presented themselves,\" Versprille said. \"The music just revealed itself to us as we kept going.\" \nBut for Pure Bathing Culture's second album, Pray for Rain, the band has taken a big leap forward. You can hear it from the opening notes of their anthemic title track: in Hindman's clean yet serpentine guitar lines interacting with the live rhythm section and Versprille's lucid vocals cutting through it all as she asks: \"Is it pleasure? Is it pain? Did you pray for rain?\" Pray for Rain is the sound of the group confidently taking a step up to the next level and finding their footing as a true band. \n\"We needed to make a big step and our version of that was to cut the cord from our previous albums,\" Hindman said of the process, then confesses: \"I was nervous all the way through. It was nerve-wracking and almost antagonizing at times.\" \nThe roots of Pure Bathing Culture stretch back to 1999, when Versprille and Hindman befriended one another on the first day of freshman orientation at William Patterson University in Wayne, New Jersey. A decade later, they became bandmates when they both joined Vetiver for their Sub-Pop albums Tight Knit and The Errant Charm. It was while playing in Vetiver that Pure Bathing Culture emerged as its own entity. \n\"Dan was working on some instrumentals that he would make on a looping pedal,\" Sarah said. \"One night he was out and I just listened to this loop and wrote some lyrics to it. He came home and I showed it to him. We laughed at first, as we didn't have some grand plan to start a band. It just happened naturally.\" That song \"Lucky One,\" wound up in the hands of Richard Swift, who encouraged the duo to keep writing. \"Richard pushed us along and became an inspiration,\" Dan said. Swift wound up producing the band's first EP and dreamy full-length, 2013's Moon Tides at his National Freedom studio. \nFrom there, PBC evolved from simply being the product of Versprille and Hindman writing songs in their own home to hitting the road as a full touring band. \"Sarah and I conceptualize music and then write so it's a pretty fragile state,\" Hindman said. \"Playing live was a huge change for us.\" \nWhen it came time to write and record their follow-up to Moon Tides, the duo knew what they didn't want. \"We didn't gravitate towards someone making indie dream-pop records,\" Dan said. That was when producer John Congleton (St. Vincent, Swans, Angel Olsen, The Walkmen) reached out to the band and invited them to come record with him in his Dallas, TX studio. \n\"John pushed us to not make clichés, to not play into the style of other bands,\" Dan said. The challenges came right away as Congleton pressed the group into unfamiliar and at times uncomfortable territory in the studio. \"He tricked me with the guitars on the album,\" Dan said. \"We got the basic tracks down and he asked me to do scratch guitar and then John wouldn't let me go back and do the guitars again. He refused to do any layering.\" \nAs a result, everything on Pray for Rain is pretty much as Pure Bathing Culture actually sounds, all analog gear, with virtually no plug-ins or effects added afterwards, no hiding behind multiple layers. \"There aren't a lot of tricks; What you hear is naturally what's there,\" Dan said. \nIt was a taxing yet ultimately rewarding experience when the album was completed. \"It was shocking to hear what the finished product was,\" Sarah said. \"It was like being in a vortex and then we came out with this record.\" She adds with a laugh something John Congleton told her when all was said and done: \"You were very brave.\" \nSarah summarizes the Pray for Rain experience as one of \"stepping into the realm of discovering who we are as a band and as songwriters,\" echoing a theme of the album itself, the process of change and transition. \"You can find the best version of yourself in those hardest moments,\" she said. To which Dan adds: \"You have to be backed up against the wall in order to really feel those feelings and respond to them.\" Pray for Rain is the sound of Pure Bathing Culture transforming from who they were to who they will be, of finding their way, ready to take steps both small and momentous on their musical path.\n                    ",

It is my hope that this work and concept can be a reminder to both myself and others to find the courage to remain sensitive through emotional challenges.

  "artistSummary": "\n                      Thao (of The Get Down Stay Down)\nThao (of the Get Down Stay Down) is a San Francisco based band fronted by singer and songwriter Thao Nguyen-She released her fourth album, A Man Alive, on March 4, 2016. Following the critical success of We The Common (2013), which was largely inspired by Thao's volunteer work with the California Coalition for Women's Prisoners, A Man Alive is an evolution in both subject matter and sound. Thao says: \"I wanted A Man Alive to be beat- and bass-driven-rather than guitar-based-extending and elaborating upon the hip-hop influences of the previous record. A Man Alive is more instrumental, more riff- and loop-centric, and has more manipulated sounds.\" The Get Down Stay Down are at their best on this record, and Thao herself experimented with programming drumbeats for several tracks, although live drums are also played on every song. \nMostly recorded at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco, A Man Alive was produced by Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards. Collaborating with Garbus, who is a close personal friend, allowed Thao to achieve the sound she had been striving for on previous releases. \"Looking back,\" she says, \"I was less sure of what I wanted. With this record I had clearer vision and aspirations. I wanted emotion. I wanted power. I wanted beats. Merrill's priority was that I take songs and ideas and run with them; she pushed us all over the place. She carved out time and space for us to experiment at will and fostered a very supportive, creative environment. Everyone was compelled to go beyond what they were comfortable doing. Musician-wise we kept it tight knit because the songs were so personal and vulnerable, and it was such an intense process, I only wanted those who know me well.\" \nA Man Alive finds Thao exploring darker and more personal territory than in her earlier songwriting. She grew up in Northern Virginia, on the outskirts of Washington, DC. When Thao was young, her father left the family. She helped out in her mother's laundromat as a teenager, sitting at the counter with a guitar, making change for customers, working on her first songs, and playing at open mics in the evenings. Her father drifted in and out of their lives. \n\"The record is essentially about my relationship with my dad, its trajectory. It's a document of my life in conjunction with his, even though we've always been leading our lives away from each other. Some are optimistic and forgiving, some are the opposite. There are songs from his perspective: I imagined what it would be like to have kids and choose to exist without them, or feel like you have to save them from yourself. I realized there was this relationship that I never really talk about, realized it's defined so much of me. So it was a point of reckoning. The record wrote itself. Painstakingly, of course.\"\n\nThe emotional center of A Man Alive is the gorgeous, plaintive \"Millionaire,\" a song about a wayward father. While the song could have ended up as a folk ballad, its instrumentation and atmosphere is of a piece with the rest of the album, pushed along by heavily reverbed synthesizer, a simple guitar riff, and subdued drums and bass. \"That's a sad fucking song,\" Thao said. \"I remember walking out of the vocal booth, and I saw Merrill tearing up. It's uncompromisingly sad, which I don't traffic well in. It took a lot.\" \nMuch of A Man Alive is vibrant and danceable-including standout tracks such as \"Astonished Man,\" \"Slash/Burn,\" \"Nobody Dies,\" and \"Meticulous Bird\"-and the juxtaposition of that exuberance with the dark themes explored in the lyrics is one of the album's great achievements. The songs are often punctuated by handclaps, sing-along choruses, and ass-shaking beats. While these songs come from a deeply personal origin, they have such an accessible quality that it is easy to imagine an engaged and participatory live audience. \"I suspect that's always been my motive,\" Thao says, \"but this is the most actualized that it's ever been. I wanted to make a record that was very introspective and personal, but it would also seek to communicate. And we would have fun performing it-not just fun, but I wanted a kind of crazy, rabid, animal energy. That's my favorite thing about performing-you can tap into this frenzy. We want people to dance and feel. And I want to do that every night, too.\" \nA Man Alive is undoubtedly a new career highlight for Thao & The Get Down Stay Down. The album presents a fiercely original group sound that is rife with experimentation and playfulness. It demonstrates Thao's development as a songwriter. And it achieves that most elusive quality in music-to create an album of songs that are dark yet buoyant, tragic yet redemptive, personal yet inclusive.\n\n-Dan Stone\n                    ",

It's like 1978 all over again, when U2 first stormed the pubs of Dublin, Ireland. \nBut this is the 21st Century in San Francisco, and the band is Zoo Station, a quartet that bills itself \"The Complete U2 Experience.\" Since 2001, this talented force has delivered the visual, musical and spiritual thrill of a U2 concert to bars, clubs, outdoor festivals, private parties and corporate events along the West Coast of North America. Singer Bonalmost leads the show, flying high with the vocal strength and confidence of Bono's The Joshua Tree days. The Sledge showers thick layers of effectual guitar work over crowd as Adamesque on bass and Barely Larry on the drums deliver the pounding heartbeat of some of modern rock's most memorable songs. \nThe band's primary job is replication, but periodically Zoo Station innovates as much as it imitates. During their trademark full-album spotlight sets in which the band plays an entire U2 album from start to finish Zoo Station encounters such obscurities as \"Elvis Presley and America,\" \"Promenade,\" \"Red Hill Mining Town\" and \"Acrobat,\" songs rarely or never performed live by U2. \n\"Songs like these are exciting,\" says Bonalmost. \"All we can really do is ask ourselves, 'What would U2 have done onstage?'\" \nMore familiar are melodies like \"Pride (In The Name of Love),\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Beautiful Day,\" and \"Vertigo.\" Behind the band, a multi-media visual projection system elevates Zoo Station's performances to the highest level of virtual authenticity. Swirling abstract imagery appears behind the stage, interspersed with rapid-fire \"U2-phemisms\" and in-synch flashing light choreography. All are recognizable from U2 shows, and these visual effects, centerpieced by Bonalmost's lively theatrics, reflect Zoo Station's deep-set love of U2′s music and their commitment to fully recreating the dense emotional impact of a U2 concert. \nSince day-one, when an earnest Craigslist posting sparked the band, Zoo Station has played over 450 shows and now flourishes a repertoire of more than 150 U2 songs. The sing-along radio hits appease casual listeners, while the most loyal U2 fans are wowed by the surprising depth and variety of the set list. Such thrilling rock and roll was made for vast arenas, one-acre stages and sky-high screens, and though U2 quit the bar scene in 1980, Zoo Station thrives there, doing what U2 no longer can: setting the smallest neighborhood pubs burning to life with a sound that has drowned out the world.\n                    ",

  "artistSummary": "From the beginning, The Dig have been a classic band's band, and a true collaboration: three longtime friends, three songwriters, two singers in a true dual frontman setup, all individuals but all woven more and more tightly together as they have evolved. In a world that rewards drama, reckless moves and often-overwrought narrative twists, The Dig have bucked that trend by focusing on, well, the work: writing song after song to cast off more than they keep, and keep only the best. The Dig do a lot, and they do it the right way — building brick by brick, writing constantly, touring steadily, and most crucially, pushing themselves creatively to make better and better records. Which brings us, of course, to Bloodshot Tokyo, a record rich with ambition and a bright, irresistible ease.\"In the past I think we've tried to create a mindset of writing 'for The Dig'\", says guitarist/keyboard playing Erick Eiser, \"so as to create something cohesive. This time I think we really freed ourselves from that, and just wrote.\" They made the most of their interconnectedness as a way to push themselves forward, writing what singer and bassist Emile Mosseri describes as \"elaborate demos\" for most of the songs. Arrangements were fully worked out, ideas were explored and re-explored before they sat down to record. Emile continues, \"It's not hard to write songs separately, but there's a thing that happens where I'll sometimes have the other guys in my head, even when I'm writing by myself. So in a way, we're kind of always writing together even when we're writing alone. We all grew up playing in different bands together since we were little kids, and have toured with and were inspired by all kinds of different bands for years. I feel like writing this record was the sum of all those years. It's the most wide spanning stylistically and colorful of our records, and also sounds the most like us.\"The result is a tremendously confident record, and one that's far punchier than its predecessors. Even with veritable piles of songs to choose from, it feels oddly apt that Bloodshot Tokyo opens with the brief snippet that is \"Ordinary Mind\". It is a sparkling, hugely inviting riff and a refrain that paves the way, just a small fragment too good to let go of. \"Jet Black Hair\" follows and is an undeniable A-sider, putting the band's pop instincts front and center, never shying away from the groove but never weighed down by it, either. Lead single \"Simple Love\" moves stealthily, winking to just a little something retro but dancing across genres in an exhilaratingly modern way. As a band, The Dig made a choice to turn somewhat from the more ambient sounds of their earlier songs, using those tones as texture to drive songs with other foundations, rather than making it the focal point. Drummer Mark Demiglio, The Dig's relative newcomer, brings a modern pop counterweight to The Dig's moodier side, and it shows. Songs like \"Pool of Rotting Water\" underline that change, going downright beat-driven with just the right amount of glam for a band that is, at its heart, very much a rock band. And what of the records return to love as a theme? Singer and guitarist David Baldwin explains, \"there are elements of both a falling in love and a break up album for sure. I think the songs we picked all generally came from so many different phases and mindsets, there might be different stages in a relationship juxtaposed into the same song. Certain songs may come off like breakup songs but were written while in the peak of a relationship. A kind of regret from the future that hasn't happened yet.\"No band escapes talking about its influences, but its particularly telling that The Dig's members often come back to The Kinks, Harry Nilsson, Betty Harris, Parliament, even Bach — artists who worked in the canon of their eras' pop music, but always with an eye toward upending pop's expectations, fraying the edges, getting weird. Baroque structures and subtle nods pop up throughout , in the low end of \"Bleeding Heart\" or the keyboard swirl of \"Simple Love\", and they permeate the art surrounding this new collection, as well.Everywhere you look these days, there are \"I could do that\"-type cynics. But could they, really? And if they did, could they keep the same wide-eyed spirit The Dig has had for years, since the band's two singers formed their first band as kids? The songs that make up this long-player have a magic borne from that dedication, where tremendous work and discipline meet a lifetime of collaboration and a joyful, insatiable love for songwriting. As it relates to one band's rock record, it may seem strange to point out how cynical the world happens to be right now, but it takes dedication and a deep well of talent to do it like The Dig do it, and do it so well.",

  "artistSummary": "Dead Meadow\nDead Meadow formed in 1998 with Jason Simon on vocals and guitar, Steve Kille on bass, and Mark Laughlin on drums. They began to combine 70s hard rock and 60s psychedelic rock with far out and sometimes mystically minded lyrical themes occasionally even hinting at the obscure genius H. P. Lovecraft and other far out writers of the bizarre and weird.[1] The first album, Dead Meadow, was released in 2000 on Tolotta Records, a label run by Fugazi bassist Joe Lally. The LP version was released by Planaria Records. This was quickly followed by 2001's Howls from the Hills, also released on Tolotta Records. At the completion of \"Howls from the Hills\" John Peel asked Dead Meadow to record a Peel Session which was recorded in Fugazi's home studio, the first time a Peel Session was recorded outside the BBC studios.[1]\n\nn Spring 2002, Laughlin parted ways with the band in order to pursue a career as a lawyer. He was replaced by long-time friend Stephen McCarty ). A live album, Got Live If You Want It, was released in mid-2002, which documented one of the last shows with drummer Mark and was produced by Anton Newcombe of Brian Jonestown Massacre. In early 2003 the band signed with Matador Records and released Shivering King and Others. Along with the heavy song and blues-influenced songs as on the previous two records, the band continued in their psychedelic style, with acoustic elements and ballads. With the addition of second guitarist Cory Shane, Feathers was released in 2005. Simon’s guitar virtuosity is influenced by the droning modal character of Eastern music as by classic rock riffs.\n\nJason Simon is the nephew of The Wire creator David Simon. Dead Meadow's music was used briefly in the episode React Quotes in season five of The Wire.\n\nIn 2007 the band has reverted back to a three piece, made an appearance at the 5th annual Green Man Festival in Crickhowell, Wales and relocated from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn the beginning of 2008, Dead Meadow released Old Growth on Matador Records. A collection of songs that brought the band back initially to the same farm that their second release Howls from the Hills was created and eventually finished up at the legendary Sunset Sound studio in Los Angeles. As with the last three albums Old Growth was produced by bassist Steve Kille.\n\nLater in that same year a brief session with Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother led to the reinterpretation of the Dead Meadow song \"Everything's Goin' On\" as a new song \"Pilgrim\" landing on the second release for Wolfmother, \"Cosmic Egg\".\n\nIn March 2010 the band released a feature length live film and soundtrack, \"Three Kings\", that spotlights their stage show along with psychedelic dream scenarios. The live footage and audio was captured at the bombastic final show of the five month \"Old Growth\" tour. The film premiered at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California[2] and was released on the NYC label Xemu Records, co-run by Kille.\n\nJason Simon also announced his September release of his first solo \"self-titled\" acoustic album on TeePee Records.\n\nThe song \"Sleepy Silver Door\" and \"Greensky Greenlake\" were featured in the skate video \"Emerica, Stay Gold.\"",

  "artistSummary": "Lumerians\nBetween the vast expanses and disparate extremes of space lies “The High Frontier:” a term coined by Gerard K O’Neil in his illustrated 1976 book depicting human colonization of space. In their new thusly titled LP, Lumerians send terrified primates into space in search of wonders both marvelous and harrowing. In a starship powered by gamma-ray-mutated rock, beer-goggled cartographers chart the absurd scales of outer space from subatomic to trans-galactic and the unfathomable void of inner space unbound by physical laws. Inward perception, both fluid and delicate, births, destroys, multiplies and collides temporal realities. Hacking through gnarled carnivorous plants with pyrokinetic machetes, Lumerians thrust forward with Krautrock inspired exploration, Afrobeat’s ritualistic rhythms, post-punk guitar noise and cracked-glacé synth lines culled from perverse 1970’s sci-fi soundtracks. As a followup to 2011’s “Transmalinnia,” “The High Frontier” sets scope outward, points blind-folded at a star map and sets off full blast without making course corrections.\n\nSince forming in 2006, Oakland’s Lumerians have gained notoriety for their intense performances, stunning live visuals and thematic otherworldly releases. Recording from their self-built studio/brewery in a converted store-front church, Lumerians acknowledge the role sound and rhythm have always played in transcendent and ecstatic rituals the world over, from the repetitious drums of tribal animists to the penetrating electronic pulses of neon dance clubs.",

  "artistSummary": "\n                      Royal Jelly Jive\nFew bands have the ability to evoke an old-school throwback vibe and yet sound entirely fresh and new at the same time. Royal Jelly is one of those bands. Combining elements of Soul, Rock, Swing and Hip-Hop, Royal Jelly shakes up any dance-party and grooves harder than your typical rock n' roll band dares to go. Fronted by the enigmatic singer Lauren Bjelde, who brings a one-of-a-kind sultry voice to her magnetic stage presence, Royal Jelly leans on the sounds of swingin' horns, gritty keys and a bumpin' rhythm section to carry a crowd into bliss... creating an unforgettable live experience that will leave you wanting more. \nBattlehooch\nBattlehooch is the kind of band you thought went extinct with landline phones & cassette tapes. In one sense they’re a band from another, sturdier era: a band that releases consistently quality material on a consistent basis, a band that doesn’t sacrifice creative drive for commercial interest, a band that grows and evolves with each successive release. From the beautiful madcap mess of debut LP Piecechow to the more refined yet still quite zany jams on Hot Lungs to a cool, polished psych-rock sheen on 2014’s Wink EP, Battlehooch has proven itself as a band built to last. They may possess an old-school mindset, but their music is weird & diverse enough to fit into this wild new century.\n\nFormed in San Francisco, the birthplace of psychedelia, it’s fitting that the six-piece collective echoes the city’s tie-dyed past in its own compositions. However, the group isn’t content with becoming a mere tribute to a time period they never lived through. Instead, Battlehooch updates the sound of psychedelia for a new generation, one that can now access dozens of genres & millions of songs with a few clicks on their iPhones. Battlehooch reflects this modern trend of manic music consumption: on any of their many releases, the listener will be treated to a sonic smorgasbord, bouncing from hard rock to dance-pop to cartoony head trips to flirtations with electronica & jazz & Afrobeat & everything else in between within the span of a few minutes, sometimes even seconds. \nLoco Tranquilo\nLoco Tranquilo is a San Francisco-based ensemble whose music features swirling, percussive jazz and international folk influences.\n                    ",

The band was originally formed by Derek Cowart and Alexander Ahmadi after he heard Cowart play a Spaceman3 song solo at a show in their home town of Fullerton, CA. The two were students at different high schools but as it turned out, of the same musical school of thought: two lovers of lo-fi, adorers of the atmospheric, kindred pop-loving spirits. The two bonded over the Velvet Underground and Brian Jonestown Massacre, and quickly turned their mutual appreciation club into a band. Cosmonauts have been making music ever since, picking up bassist James Sanderson and a host of different drummers along the way (the spot is currently filled by Mark Morones). Now residing in Los Angeles, they’ve put out a number of releases (including three full length albums) through Burger Records and various other labels.\n\nThey’ve toured extensively through the US and Europe, and played alongside Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Pixies, Slowdive, Black Lips, Belle & Sebastian, and more, though Cosmonauts don’t exactly fit neatly into the fabric of their scene: too psychedelic to be punk, too punk to be psychedelic, and too absorbed in making their own brand of music to care.\n\nTheir latest offering, A-OK!, is out August 19th via Burger Records.",

What takes the most time is writing separately and turning it into a cohesive whole. Mosshart expounds, “If ‘Ash & Ice’ were a painting, it would be incredibly complex. It would be one that looked like it had been painted over and over and over and over. It would be so thick off the wall, it would be coming through the frame.”",

The band’s global megahit “Bittersweet Symphony” – which Chris Martin famously called “the best song ever written, sung by the best singer in the world” – made them stars in the States and heroes at home. He’s played Saturday Night Live, graced the cover of Rolling Stone, been nominated for VMAs, GRAMMY’s, and The Mercury Prize but he’s never made a soul record with a hot shot hip-hop producer and venerated Motown greats, until now. In 2009, Ashcroft disbanded The Verve and focused on writing songs inspired by his love of soul, funk and gospel. The result is his first solo album in four years, United Nations Of Sound.",

Four years later, however, and following a burst of creativity instigated by personal upheaval and the general living of lives they’re about to release their second album in the space of six months – following Do It Again, their collaborative mini-album with fellow Scandinavian legend, Robyn – in the shape of the multi-faceted, The Inevitable End.",

If the music of the African diaspora boomerangs all over the world— picking up bits of regional flavor wherever locals develop a taste for jazz, blues, gospel, reggae and other styles—then certainly, Chicano Batman’s sound is steeped in Tropicália from Brazil, Peruvian psych-rock and Mexican garage jams, as well as American soul. The styles all reflect off each other in one way or another. The band makes excellent use of wah-wahs, overdriven organ and generally retro effects, playing dance-friendly music that is still totally 21st-century American.” – John Adamian, Relix Magazine\n                    ",

Rhythms and textures drawn from New Orleans funk, 90s club house, 60s salsa and hip­hop all collide and fracture upon one another on their new LP, Jukestone Paradise. Dubbed “raucous and captivating” by Okayplayer, their album cuts play like the soundtrack for a ride through Brooklyn’s diverse neighborhoods, where the group’s sound materialized. And the Pimps’ live experience only takes it higher. Over the past decade, the group’s grassroots following mobilized from the underground club scene in New York to sell out historic venues like the Fillmore in San Francisco and showcase at festivals across the US and Europe. With more than 1 million Spotify plays to date, it seems word truly does spread to the wise. And when you pair high­caliber musicianship with rhythm and groove as universally enticing as it is unconventional, there’s no denying the dancefloor. \n\nMarchFourth MarchFourth is a joy-inducing force of entertainment. This colorful explosion of brassy funk, rock, and jazz emanates from musicians, acrobats, stilters and more, touring the country year-round, taking audiences on a booty-shaking, soul-stirring journey that defies categorization. Fifteen MarchFourth musicians traveled from Portland, Oregon to New Orleans, Louisiana to record their fourth studio album, MAGIC NUMBER. With Producer Ben Ellman (Galactic) and Engineer/Producer Mikael “Count” Eldridge (DJ Shadow, Tycho, Galactic, Trombone Shorty) at the helm, the album is full of the captivating grooves and brassy swagger you’d expect from M4, plus a healthy dose of New Orleans magic, with guest appearance by Trombone Shorty, Stanton Moore (drums), and Matt Perrine (sousaphone). The album was fan-funded through Kickstarter (out September 30, 2016). \n\n“Perfectly merging the artistic spirit of Portland with the musical spectacle of New Orleans, MarchFourth put on one of the most complete shows of any band on any stage. From rocking big band jam tunes, choreography and feats of strength that need to be seen to be believed, MarchFourth entertains on every level every second they are on the stage…or off!” ~Rex Thomson, Live for Live Music “From the first note to the last, the sound was pumping and the fun never stopped… It’s worth noting that there are serious musicians behind all the fun. I was a music major in college and it’s obvious these guys (and gals) have had lots of training and formal practice. Talented band geeks turned rebels. When one of the horn players steps up to improvise a solo, you know it’s going to be a treat.” ~ Tim Leffel, USAToday “You could call MarchFourth a Vaudeville circus, or a sexy carnivalesque sideshow of animalistic proportions where all sense of decorum is beaten into submission. I call it a panoply for the senses, a celebratory feast of friends, a visually stunning performance that sears itself into your brain.” ~Mike Greenblatt, The Aquarian\n                    \n                    ",

  "artistSummary": "What does deep house, the work of Stockhausen, a self-programmed snake and a frozen Lily Cole have in common? No, it’s not the contents of a lost episode of Skins. Nor is it the XX’s Christmas list. It is, rather, just a few of the details that make up Clean Bandit, a new four-piece that in their playfulness and willingness to trample over musical boundaries offer a refreshing new direction for dance music in 2013. Forget your rock revivalists or your retrofitted soul crooners, Clean Bandit could not have emerged at any time other than now. Comprised of brothers Jack and Luke Patterson alongside the classically-trained pair of Grace Chatto and Neil Amin-Smith, the group formed in 2008. One night , in the dingy confines of a Cambridge nightclub, classic music met bass music, and it never looked back. “It was at the band’s own club night called National Rail Disco. We set it up because we thought there was a real lack of new interesting music at the time. The first ever one was basically set up so we could perform. But as it carried on it became more of a straightforward club night we DJ’d or played live most weeks alongside other DJs and electronic acts we loved.” The students, not normally thought to be a particularly clubby kind of crowd, were into it. “They loved it, it was really successful and always completely packed”, says Jack. “People didn’t expect the students to be into it, but they were. They all had a real appetite for the music. One of the coolest things was the night we had James Blake down. Three quarters of the way through his set he just played a Destiny’s Child acapella on its own. Even though there was no beat,. people just went completely off. That was amazing.” National Rail Disco provided Clean Bandit with a blueprint for everything that was to follow. First, there was a willingness to take risks. Second a desire to blend beats and strings. Third, it was done in a DIY fashion, using whatever resources were to hand.â€¨But first they decided to move to Moscow. Grace to learn the language and play cello. Jack followed her, and ended up enrolling in Russia’s famous film school, The Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. “I didn’t have much to do in Moscow and someone mentioned a film course that was open to international students so I thought I’d give it a try. It was a five year course,” Jack recalls. “I didn’t do the whole thing, but the whole of the first year you only do black and white still images. In the second year you do moving images but still only in black and white. It was all in Russian too, and to begin with none of the students spoke a word of it.” It was at the Gerasimov that Jack’s ideas of blending music recordings with filmmaking began to take shape. “I was making music on a laptop a lot while I was there”, he says. “It was still a hobby though. I had long days at film school and then would come home and have a go messing around making music. I wrote Mozart’s House while I was out there. I was listening to a lot of house music there, there was a little boutique outside our flat that would blast out house for 24 hours. Maybe that seeped in.” Now, in 2013, Clean Bandit are still mixing things up. Currently residing in London, this electroquartet are applying their principles to a whole new range of possibilities. Listen to single ‘A&E’ and you’ll hear classical, bucolic strings intertwining with UK funky bass and a melody of modern electronic pop. It’s a new sophisticated sound, but one that’s distinctive of our capital. The soulful vocals, meanwhile, are sung by guests Kandaka Moore and Nikki Marshall, found by chance in the group’s new home of Kilburn. “They were part of local community singing and dancing group next door to our studio”, says Jack. “We thought they would be perfect for this track.” And so they are, sharing the enthusiasm of the track and, also, the versatility of the group. Moore also volunteered as a dancer for the video, which necessitated her being part of a stop-motion animation. “She was completely unfazed by being painted gold over the course of two hours”, notes Jack. That was far from being the most complicated part of the production, by the way. The video for A&E also required the creation of a golden snake. A serpent that, as in a real life game of Snake, slithered across central London. It was a challenge, one that Jack – typically – took it upon himself to rise to. So how do you make a snake? “We made it on the computer”, he says. “I taught myself to use Cinema 4D. I studied architecture at uni, so I had kind of got into 3d graphics, modeling and animation. Luke learned how to do the fluid dynamics, because the snake had to go through water at the beginning.” Clean Bandit have also been getting a taste of a different experience closer to home whilst on tour this spring with teenage chart conquerors Disclosure. “The tour was really fun”, says Jack. “It was great to see how that world worked and to be in these really cool clubs up and down the country was brilliant. There were screaming fans. We had people who knew the words to our songs, which was quite amazing to see. It was unexpected.”â€¨The stakes were raised even higher for new single ‘Dust Clears’. This concept video, also directed by Jack, was half-filmed on the frozen lakes of northern Sweden in winter. “In this video all the band work in a factory, but the lead singer is an older guy who’s got this fantasy of being an ice skater”, says Jack, with a smile. “We filmed the skating in Sweden and that was great, we used some special techniques. Two of us were towed along on a sled with two different lenses, two cameras filming our dear friend Nick as he skated past. Nick is our friend’s dad and while we were thinking about making the video we heard that when he was 17 he was a Scottish figure skating champion. When you see the video, you’ll see why we found this quite amazing.” Quite clearly kids of the internet generation, Clean Bandit aren’t precious about where they find inspiration or how they deploy it (the aforementioned Lily Cole volunteered to stand in a freezing cold swimming pool for the video to UK Shanty, in return for Jack giving her a tutorial on her new video camera). Neither are they devoted to one type of creativity. They make music, they make video, they perform live. “We try to think of each piece as being a music video rather than a song”, says Jack. “Videos for songs is the output. That’s how we’d like it to be digested. Now we’re doing more and more music, we’re having to make stuff without the videos, but hopefully we’ll be able to catch up.”",

She has spent the last several years writing her 5th release titled “45 Miles”and will begin recording in the summer of 2015.\n\nWhen asked to sum up her last 15 years, Lembo says this: “The purpose of my semi-retirement from music was to discover who I am off the stage. I had spent most of my life prior either on the stage or, trying to get on it. The irony is, the work I was doing often times brought me on stage to talk with hundreds or even, thousands of people. I guess it is just who I am. That said, I’m much more interested in evolving and growing as a musician than trying to be a rock star. I’m fascinated by how music heals, moves, motivates and brings us together in community. It is a spiritual quest now, the wannabe rock star days behind me. I wasn’t very good at it anyway. I’m much better at being part of the whole of the experience as opposed to being the focus. ”\n\nLook for Lembo’s upcoming album, “45 Miles” 2016.",

  "artistSummary": "Tim Cohen\nTim Cohen wants make you aware of life’s imperfections; he likes to play devil’s advocate…or maybe he's more like the devil’s buddy, offering up his own dark but playful asides. On Luck Man, the Fresh & Only’s and Magic Trick frontman’s first solo record for Sinderlyn, Cohen has created a lush, insular world that deals with the uneasiness of accepting life’s inherent flaws. \n\nRecorded in his attic and at El Studio in San Francisco after recently moving back to a city he longed called home, Luck Man is a personal statement distilled from Cohen’s own experiences. “I draw upon little moments and memories to make music,” he says. “I like to think I’m leaving bits of wisdom behind, but I don’t possess the wisdom for longer than it takes to make a song. I inherit it momentarily, write it down, attach a melody that fits the words in rhythm, and then record it.” Attempting to answer the unanswerable, Cohen aims to fill this existential void with his songwriting.\n\nThe intricacies of tracks like “I Need A Wife” and \"John Hughes\" belie Cohen’s seemingly simple writing process where warmth and comfort meets a questioning anxiety. However, there's always more to each song than meets the eye. Influenced by Van Morrison's Veedon Fleece as well as his one-time day job as a delivery driver (see \"Meat Is Murder\") and other daily travails, Cohen eschews focusing on overarching topics like love, hope or despair and, instead, creates his own stories with fleeting, yet quietly complex characters and thoughts. \n\nAfter over a decade of writing and releasing music under various monikers, it's clear that Cohen is more than capable of producing a beautiful record, whether or not you want to dig deeper into life's nagging paradoxes is solely up to you.",

  "artistSummary": "Pi Jacobs\nLos Angeles singer-songwriter Pi Jacobs plays what she calls an “Americana bluesy rock thing,” one nonetheless edged by accents evoking her urban San Francisco childhood. Enamored of her mother’s rock- and soul-heavy music collection, she sang throughout school, picking up guitar, bass and songwriting as a teenager. She earned her GED and left high school early, then pursued music studies at the local junior college. A period of woodshedding, gigging and recording ensued, culminating in the release of Pi’s debut album. She spent two years in New York before landing in L.A., which has proven fertile creative ground and a convenient base for touring. \"A Little Blue\" is Pi’s seventh record, coming March 31, 2017 on The Travianna Records label. \n\nA LITTLE BLUE\n\nOn tour in late 2016, in the tiny town of Floyd, VA. Pi met the head of Mountain Fever Records, the premiere US bluegrass label. Mark Hodges, the president of Mountain Fever, immediately signed Pi to his new Americana label, Travianna Records. In between European and US touring last year, Pi went out to Floyd to work with Producer and multi-instrumentalist, Aaron Ramsey. The result is a true collaboration of Pi's “Americana bluesy rock thing,” and Aaron's deep bluegrass roots. A truly unique album, \"A Little Blue\" will be released in March of 2017. We can't wait!",

From Phoenix to NYC and from Boston to South Florida to Scotland, she's toured as a mostly-solo act, collecting stories and creating musical vignettes while headlining at nationally recognized venues such as Club Passim, The Bitter End, and The Freight and Salvage.\n\nGarlin started her career as a school teacher. All the while there has been another call to adventure, a tugging on the guitar strings that has moved her to write and record and tour and perform. Her April 2015 release, Wink at July, continues in the folk-rock storytelling vein that brought her accolades from the New York Songwriter’s Circle, Performing Songwriter Magazine, and won her first place in the Newport Folk Festival’s Talent Search. Media fans include Curve Magazine (“storytelling at its best” ) and Diffuser Magazine (“an impressive catalogue of unforgettable stories.”) Garlin’s songs have also aired on Click and Clack's Car Talk, NPR’s Democracy Now, and radio stations throughout the country. Her live performances bring together a natural stage presence and the same folk, rock, and Americana flavors that season her recordings.",

  "artistSummary": "EMMURE sets the standard for bringing together an emotionally unhinged blend of blistering hardcore and punishing death metal that appeals to a wide array of fans ranging from THE ACACIA STRAIN and SUICIDE SILENCE to DEFTONES and label-mates A DAY TO REMEMBER. They released Goodbye To The Gallows (2007) and The Respect Issue (2008) on Victory Records, but it was Felony (2009) that blew things wide open for the band as they truly began to hone their definitive sound that really connected with a worldwide audience. Motivated, EMMURE released their fifth full-length project, Slave to the Game, released April 10th, 2012, only one year after releasing Speaker of the Dead (2011). Delivering unapologetic lyrics that could make your mother cry, Slave to the Game embraced the video-game-loving side of the band, incorporating references to old school arcade favorites such as Street Fighter II, while still maintaining their rage-infused metal roots. Between powerfully low chugging, technical riffs and bone crushing drum work, the album provided metal fans with classic EMMURE sounds, while still able to openly experiment with tune and pitch effects. Overtime, one thing has become overwhelmingly clear; you are either with EMMURE or against them. Frankie Palmeri has made a conscious effort to push as many buttons in the industry as possible and for some, his sarcastic, ironic humor is anything but charming. Never one to bite his tongue, Palmeri has made EMMURE a band that is as impossible to ignore as they are to forget. ",

Always an anomaly among his country music peers, Wayne's uncompromising interpretation of the music he loves is in fact what defines him: steeped in traditional but never \"retro;\" bare bones but bone shaking; hardcore but with a swing. Like the comfortable crackle of a Wurlitzer 45 jukebox, Wayne is the embodiment of genuine, house rocking, hillbilly boogie.\nWayne makes music fit for any road house anywhere. With his unmistakable voice, The Train's reckless honky-tonk can move the dead. If you see him live (and he is ALWAYS touring), you'll surely work up some sweat stains on that snazzy Rayon shirt you're wearing. If you buy his records, you'll be rolling up your carpets, spreading sawdust on the hardwood, and dancing until the downstairs neighbors are banging their brooms on the ceiling. Call him a throwback if you want, Wayne just wants to ENTERTAIN you, and what's wrong with that?\nWayne's disdain for the slick swill that passes for real deal country is well known. Like he's fond of saying: \"Man, I'm like a stab wound in the fabric of country music in Nashville. See that bloodstain slowly spreading? That's me.\"\nLittle known fact: Wayne is the only Bloodshot artist to have had their CD taken aboard a space shuttle flight.\n\"A rare breed of traditionalist, one who imbues his retro obsessions with such high energy and passions that his songs never feel like the museum pieces he's trying desperately to preserve.\" —AllMusic.com",

  "artistSummary": "\n                      Sinkane \nSinkane music — every note of it — comes straight out of a generosity of spirit. Never has that spirit been on more vivid display than on the uplifting new album Life & Livin’ It. This is feel-good music for trying times, celebrating what makes life good without ignoring what makes it hard. \nBy the time they finished touring for their acclaimed Mean Love album in late 2015, Ahmed Gallab and the band had spread the gospel of Sinkane to the world, playing 166 shows in 20 countries. During the same period, he had also led The Atomic Bomb Band— the highly celebrated 15-piece outfit that played the music of elusive Nigerian electro-funk maestro William Onyeabor. The band included David Byrne, Damon Albarn, members of Hot Chip, LCD Soundsystem, The Rapture, Jamie Lidell and legendary jazz musicians Pharoah Sanders and Charles Lloyd, and they played all over the planet, including making their TV debut on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. “Those 14 months really changed my life,” Ahmed says. “Not only did I learn how to put on a bigger show, but all that touring brought Sinkane closer as a band.\"\n\nAs Ahmed got into the depths of writing for Life & Livin’ It, he had a clear goal; to\nconjure the ups and downs of a universal experience, and have fun while doing it. “I would listen to my favorite records, like Funkadelic’s America Eats Its Young, and realize how great they made me feel. That carefree, light and fun feeling I was getting while writing this record is what I want everyone to feel when they listen to it.\"\n\nAhmed soon brought the band in to help with the material, testing the songs at a four-show residency of sold-out shows at Union Pool in Brooklyn where the audience’s reception fed the creative process. They toured throughout the summer before setting up shop at Sonic Ranch Studios in El Paso, Texas. Once again produced by Ahmed with lyrics and help from longtime collaborator Greg Lofaro, the album draws from the best elements of Sinkane’s previous records: the slinky funk and soul grooves are there, so are the sparkling melodies with roots in sub-Saharan Africa. With basic tracking played together live, the fun and immediacy of Sinkane’s live show is a central feeling of the recordings. Each one of the four members of Sinkane - bassist Ish Montgomery, drummer Jason Trammell, guitarist Jonny Lam and Ahmed – sing and contribute additional parts on the album, with Trammell contributing lyrics to “Theme from Life & Livin’ It,” and Lam helping with arrangements. Jas Walton and Jordan MacLean of Daptone recording artists Antibalas contributed horns.\n\nIn making a record that feels like this, Ahmed’s primary intention was to make music that is joyous, but also socially conscious when you scratch beneath the surface. The songs “U’Huh” and “Theme from Life & Livin’ It” conjure up the simple pleasures of hanging with friends, but there are heavier vibes in there. Ahmed says, “I remember listening to Bob Marley as a child. Dancing with my family in our living room and then my mother telling me what issues he was addressing, and that it was important to remember those things while listening. It made the music even better because it became about something more.\"\n\n“Favorite Song” came about from Ahmed's experiences DJ’ing in New York. “As a DJ you’re always paying attention to the collective energy in the club. When you play a song that everyone knows, everybody is connected, lost in the music.” That song, along with “U’Huh”, has lyrics sung in Arabic, Ahmed's native tongue. “Kulu shi tamaam!” means “everything is great!” while “ya zol ya zain!” is a Sudanese term of endearment meaning “my beautiful friend.” “It’s really easy to understand the tone of those words,\" Ahmed adds. \"They just feel good, you don’t have to know what they mean. It’s kind of like listening to Caetano Veloso or Jorge Ben — you don’t have to know Portuguese to feel what they’re saying.”\n\nTrue to its name, Life & Livin’ It is an album about all kinds of experiences. When Ahmed Gallab sings, he sounds unafraid yet vulnerable. But while he once sang of feeling like he was on the planet Mars, Ahmed is now firmly grounded on Earth. He’s no longer searching for his home — he has created a home for himself. There’s a party there, and Life & Livin’ It is playing on the stereo. You are invited.\n                    ",

  "artistSummary": "Of course you don’t need to attach more importance to this piece of news than it necessarily has, but it certainly deserves to be mentioned: for the first time in more than 20 years, one of the most British rock bands in music history has recorded a studio album in their native country. Their latest offering is entitled A Conspiracy Of Stars, was cut by rock legend UFO and breathes that typically British easy-going confidence for which this band has been known for over 45 years. A strong release consisting of eleven songs which combine everything that the group surrounding frontman Phil Mogg stands for: meaty riffs, distinctive hooks, diverse songwriting, intelligent lyrics and that generally laid-back attitude which we have associated with UFO from the start. The fact that A Conspiracy Of Stars was produced and mixed by Chris Tsangarides (Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore, among others) may be considered another successful element in a thoroughly consistent release. To cut a long story short: their 22nd studio recording to date sees UFO prove that past and present can be blended in a homogeneous whole. ",

While keeping his trademark soulful baritone at the forefront, José adeptly weaves elements of indie rock, folk, funk, blues, hip hop and R&B into an experience journeying from desire to introspection and spiritual epiphany. “As an artist, I’m going to keep evolving,” he says resolutely. “I think my fans have now come to expect this from me. They want to know what I’m going to do next.”",

Tasked with introducing Wondervisions, Delicate Steve's beguiling debut record of highly evocative and emotionally concise guitar-driven songs, Luaka Bop, the seminal David Byrne-owned New York indie label, balked. There was the music to get to; itself essentially reference-less and unqualifiedly unique. But what of the guy who created it? The guitarist who wrote the whole thing, who played every instrument. An enormous unknown talent without an attendant backstory to match the spectral and boundless qualities of his music. Enter Chuck Klosterman. The celebrated writer was brought on to completely fabricate a biography based on a band and album he was asked not to listen to. ",

But apparently an all-for-one philosophy of songwriting and identity is an anomaly in the modern era of music. \n \nRecorded in a marathon one-week session at Studio 606, \"Above Snakes\" finds San Francisco's Down and Outlaws fine-tuning their place musically and striving to channel the restless, pissed off spirits of rock and roll history. \n \nAs Above Snakes -- an old west term meaning \"still alive\" -- suggests, the band believes in music that's fresh, yet pleasantly unpolished; brash, but wary; accessible, but never cheap. \n \nIn \"I Don't Care,\" Peter Danzig proclaims: \"I'm a sickness/ I'm a cheat/ I don't care if I feel a thing.\" And the whole band joins in to scream the title line with an urgency that proves just the opposite. \n \nWith appearances at Outsidelands, SXSW, Noise Pop, and Echo Park Rising under their belt, the band's show is the source and primary outlet of that urgency. A friend recently commented, \"I've been trying to record your set for months, but you're too fuckin' loud!\" This music is based on freedom and escape from everything else that drags you down, if only for 40 minutes. \n \n\"Raw energy, blistering guitar leads and dirty vocals over thick bass lines and driving drums. Though their aesthetic is dark and brooding, they write songs that are smartly accessible.\" — San Franpsycho (Bands You Need to Know)\n\n\ndownandoutlaws.com\n\n\nMaszer (Members of Reignwolf)\n\n\nFrom guttered with tears in a 70's van to the glorious nights under the moon we bring you MASZER!

Always an anomaly among his country music peers, Wayne’s uncompromising interpretation of the music he loves is in fact what defines him: steeped in traditional but never \"retro;\" bare bones but bone shaking; hardcore but with a swing.\n\n\nLike the comfortable crackle of a Wurlitzer 45 jukebox, Wayne is the embodiment of genuine, house rocking, hillbilly boogie. Wayne makes music fit for any road house anywhere. With his unmistakable voice, The Train’s reckless honky-tonk can move the dead. If you see him live (and he is ALWAYS touring), you’ll surely work up some sweat stains on that snazzy Rayon shirt you’re wearing. If you buy his records, you’ll be rolling up your carpets, spreading sawdust on the hardwood floor, and dancing until the downstairs neighbors are banging their brooms on the ceiling. Call him a throwback if you want, but all Wayne Hancock wants to do, is simply ENTERTAIN you, and what's wrong with that?\n\n\nwaynehancock.com\n\n\nBig Sandy & His Fly-Rite Boys\n\n\nOver the last three decades, Big Sandy and his Fly-Rite Boys have kept up a constant cycle of traveling back and forth across the lower 48, then hopping across the pond to Europe and beyond. They bring with them a brand of American music that has earned them an induction into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, several national television appearances, guest spots on The Grand Ole Opry, and a slew of adoring fans.\n \n\"I truly love being out on the road, and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to sing my songs all over the world,\" said Sandy. \"But when I'm away from the U.S. for too long, it's like I need a recharge... like I need a solid dose of everything Americana. Give me a Chuck Berry song while rolling down the interstate, or a truck stop conversation with a waitress who once danced with Lefty Frizzell, and I'm good for another three thousand miles”.\n \nbigsandy.net\n                    ",

They hit the road and developed a synergy that is evident on their sophomore release, Road, Bridges, & Ruins. On this release we saw the rise of co-vocalist, Chris Matulich, who brought melody and nuance to their sound, and made them contemporaries with bands like Gaslight Anthem and The Menzingers.\n\n\nArmed with two songwriters and two singers, Nothington jumped to Chicago label Red Scare for 2011's Borrowed Time. This was a breakout release and by this time the band was so popular in Europe that they frequently made transatlantic trips and were getting tour oers from mainstream bands. But all the while Nothington stayed diligent to their craft and loyal to their core audience: the outsiders who sing along with beers held high.\n\n\n​In The End will be the first full length studio album from the band in 5 years. After playing a thousand sweaty shows and the occasional spurt of activity in the form of a 7\" or a tour with The Lawrence Arms, the band went into hibernation. The guys needed to catch their breath, catch up with friends, and catch up with adulthood. But recently things have materialized and Nothington plans on making a triumphant return to Europe to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of their first album.\n\n\nnothington.com\n\n\nDruglords of the Avenues\n\n\nFormed in 2004 in Oakland California. This band is a side project for some and a side, side project for others.

Plain and simple, Great Apes are a punk band from San Francisco. Minimalism reigns. Play it fast, play it loud, and make it stick. While we all have been or are in an array of more complex projects, this band is founded on pop-sensible simplicity and the notion that music, much like a bio, is often at its finest when it’s spit out intensely, with concision and honesty.\n\n\nmormonteen.com\n\n\nCut Up\n\n\nDirty Pop Punk\n\n\ncutupsf.bandcamp.com\n                    ",

Formed in 2007 by sisters Gwennie and Lucy Giles, the duo draws influence from the classic sounds of the Ramones as well as contemporaries Ty Segall to synthesize their own unique style. Careful listeners will also notice a nod to bands like Cub and Tiger Trap, the former of Sacramento, CA lineage as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a recent tour with Swimmers to their tour credentials that already include tour dates in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, France, and across the Unites States. Dog Party will be hitting the road all summer, including two Southern California Burger Records showcases. \n \nBoth play a multitude of instruments, but their live show consists of Lucy on drums and Gwendolyn on guitar with both sisters sharing lead vocal duties. The Dog Party live show owes a debt of influence to old Bikini Kill footage they both have absorbed, and also Sex Bob-omb — that’s right, the fictional band from the cult comic book series Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They have an uncanny ability to incite nostalgic awe in older audience members, while fueling the fire of frenzied dancing in the younger ones.\n \ndogpartylive.tumblr.com\n\n\n\nDirty Denim\n\n\nCombining obscure sixties garage with 50’s/60’s girl rock and garage punk, all girl trio Dirty Denim bring a refreshing bit of fan fetishism to the impetus of sleazy rock ‘n roll. After guitarist and lead singer Katie Rose (BOMP! Records baby of les Hell on Heels) migrated down to San Francisco from Portland, Oregon with bassist Laura Svec, they eventually joined with drummer Raquel Reyes (The Peppermints) to form Dirty Denim. They swiftly made their mark in the North Bay area gigging with local and touring bands at S.F. venues such as; Great American Music Hall, Rickshaw Stop and Bottom of the Hill. This year (2016) they added a fourth badass, Niki Kangas, who juggles keyboard, guitar and tambourine.\n\n\nDirty Denim doubled down with explosive keys, catchy riffs and backup gang vocals that are impossible not to sing. Watching them go from 3 shy girls nervously giggling into microphones... to an all out WILDFIRE on stage has captivated me. Always obsessed to see what they'll do next and literally twitching to hear their FIRST FULL LENGTH RECORD (set to release this year)... I wait impatiently. Dirty Denim is now headlining local shows and supporting great bands like, The Coathangers, The Birth Defects, Shannon & the Clams and many others. These are four of the hardest working women in the industry, so catch these busy bees any time you can!

Virtually unknown outside Denver upon release, the band gathered acclaim over the ensuing months and by year end had landed in the #9 spot on Decibel Magazine’s annual top 40 albums of the year, not a small accomplishment for a band on its debut album. \n \nThe new album ‘Hunted’ reveals a Khemmis fortified in its purpose and vision, forging an unrivaled synthesis between immense Doom riffs and Maiden-esque harmony. Overall song length has increased yielding more expansively arranged and dramatic storms of elegance and melancholy. \n \nAnd yet Khemmis are not content to plod through a sea of tears, they are always a rock band first, in service to the movement of the song, even approaching a High On Fire like pace to open the pummeling \"Three Gates.\" The lauded singing of vocalist Phil Pendergast reaches ascendant new heights on tracks like \"Candlelight\" and \"Beyond The Door,\" while the tasteful use of harsh vocals remains, providing a dark foreboding contrast. The 13-minute title track once again closes the album with an epic stunner. \n \nUndoubtedly ‘Hunted’ is an album that will solidify Khemmis’ place at the vanguard of doom’s most notable modern manifestations, in large part because they transcend the label itself. They’ve seamlessly blended their influences into an extraordinarily listenable album worthy of countless spins. With such a glut of music released today, ‘Hunted’ stands apart, rewarding repeat listens with songs seared straight into the heart.\n\n\nkhemmisdoom.com\n\n\nJaye Jayle was conceived by singer/songwriter Evan Patterson (also of the band Young Widows) in late 2013. Last year, Jaye Jayle released four limited edition single 7 inches on four different record labels of 8 songs from a recording made prior to ever performing in a live setting. A new album is on the horizon. Cheers.\n\n\njayejayle.bandcamp.com\n                    ",

After a horrible accident involving many drugs and a chemical spill, the Bots became self aware and captured the human, now renamed JBOT. It was decided that they would travel the country, rocking out while bent on world domination and humiliating the masked and chained idiotic human in front of his human peers.\n\n\nAs well, JBOT’s mask was removed, after 15 years of captivity removal of the mask serves to show how ugly and disgusting the human JBOT really is. The Bots and JBOT’s relationship has changed, now they are much more united in hating humanity. Stockholm syndrome?

Their debut single, \"Kingdom Leader\" was premiered and featured as Song of the Week on HillyDilly.com. The track made blog and radio waves abroad with features on The Music Ninja and LaBelle Musique and received airplay on KCRW (California), and on XFM in the UK. \n\nA song that drips sexual foreplay and massages the soul. A combination of pulsating synthsounds that bed down layered textures of electronic bass and percussive beats. The sonic stimulations throughout the track enthral, and asks you to delve deeper with every second of the song. The single peaked at #6 on the Australian iTunes Electronic chart. 'Kingdom Leader' was also placed on high rotation on Triple J and played on community stations around the country. \n\nInfluenced by the layerings and experimental beats of Major Lazer, the cool swagger of J-Dilla and The Seed 2.0's Cody Chestnutt's soulful vocal delivery.

Adrianne's voice and guitar playing speak of rich emotional territory with grace and insight. In her words, the record tracks \"the masterpiece of existence, which is always folding into itself, people attempting to connect, to both shake themselves awake and to shake off the numbness of certain points in their life. The interpretations might be impressionistic or surrealistic, but they're grounded in simple things.\n\nAdrianne met her longtime musical partner, guitarist and singer, Buck Meek, in Brooklyn a few years ago, and they quickly formed a creative bond tempered by the experience of traveling and performing for months on end in old dive bars, yards, barns, and basements together. They recorded a pair of duo albums (A-Sides and B-Sides), and Adrianne showcased her songs on a solo album, Hours Were The Birds.\n\nNow, as a full rock and roll band, with Buck on guitar, Max Oleartchik on bass, and James Krivchenia on drums, they bring a steady wildness, giving the songs an even deeper layer of nostalgia. \n\n\"The songs of Adrianne Lenker and guitarist Buck Meek are tender and poetic, with punch, philosophical, thoughtful and singable.\" --NPR Music",

  "artistSummary": "CHASTITY BELT\nChastity Belt is a rock band consisting of four friends - guitarists Julia Shapiro and Lydia Lund, bassist Annie Truscott, and drummer Gretchen Grimm. They met in a tiny college town in Eastern Washington, but their story begins for real in Seattle, that celebrated home of Macklemore and the Twelfth Man. Following a post-grad summer apart, a handful of shows and enthusiastic responses from the city's DIY community led them, as it has countless others, into a cramped practice space. They emerged with a debut album, No Regerts, sold it out faster than anyone involved thought possible, and toured America, a country that embraced them with open-ish arms. Now they're back and the tab is settled, the lights are out, the birds are making noise even though the sun isn't really up yet: it's Time to Go Home, their second long-player and first for Hardly Art.\n\nIn the outside world, they realized something crucial: they didn't have to play party songs now that their audience didn't consist exclusively of inebriated 18-22 year olds, as it did in that college town. Though still built on a foundation of post-post-punk energy, jagged rhythms, and instrumental moves that couldn't be anyone else's, the songs they grew into in the months that followed are equal parts street-level takedown and gray-skied melancholy. They embody the sensation of being caught in the center of a moment while floating directly above it; Shapiro's world spins around her on \"On The Floor,\" grounded by Grimm and Truscott's most commanding playing committed to tape. They pay tribute to writer Sheila Heti on \"Drone\" and John Carpenter with \"The Thing,\" and deliver a parallel-universe stoner anthem influenced by Electrelane with \"Joke.\"\n\nRecorded by José Díaz Rohena at the Unknown, a deconsecrated church and former sail factory in Anacortes, and mixed with a cathedral's worth of reverb by Matthew Simms (guitarist for legendary British post-punks and one-time tourmates Wire), Time to Go Home sees Chastity Belt take the nights out and bad parties of their past to their stretching points, watch the world around them break apart in anticipatory haze, and rebuild it in their own image with stunning clarity before anyone gets hungover.",

Since 2014's 'Blue Break EP' he has been locked away harnessing the sound that has taken this classically trained vocalist and pianist into the hazy no-mans-land between jazz, R&B, soul, hip hop and electronica. 'Couch Baby' is the stunning summation of the young talent's journey so far.\n\nAs a self-sufficient producer and composer he describes his own music as \"brooding, cinematic and minimalist.\" This soundscape, which sways from ambient melody to head bopping grooves has already won him many fans in high places like Zane Lowe, Pitchfork and Huw Stephens. The debut record, with its ear worm crooning, and emotive depth and palette, sounds as natural next to the trippy jazz of Kendrick Lamar and Thundercat as it does the spacious atmospherics of The xx.\n\nThree years in the making, 'Couch Baby' has been a \"calming outlet\" for Jamie. It's the latest in a string of releases from him and his friends in the SE LDN crew that have collectively defined the areas new sonic trademarks, \"Other artists say they're from south London, but they haven't got the south London sound. There's a certain feeling that you have to get with it, it's a certain mellowness.\"",

  "artistSummary": "WRABEL\nSongs of his -- like \"Ten Feet Tall,\" recorded by Afrojack-have been heard by millions of people around the world. \n\nWrabel specializes in music that telescopes small moments into songs with big impact. On tracks like \"11 Blocks\" and \"Gimme Your Love,\" the drums may get huge, but the feelings are deeply personal. This is pop music rooted in the singer-songwriter tradition, and it all starts with Wrabel sitting at a piano, fighting for self-expression and survival.\n\nWrabel was born 27 years ago on Long Island. His father was a salesman, and by the time he was in high school he had lived all over the country, even as far as Australia. Over and over he was the new kid in school. \n\nBy 16, he was in high school in Houston and had begun playing piano. A summer program at the Berklee College of Music in Boston led to his enrollment at the college. While at Berklee, Wrabel posted original songs on MySpace, so when a songwriter in England invited him to come over for a writing session, he knew he wasn't long for school. \n\nBefore the end of his first semester, Wrabel left school and headed to Los Angeles. The song \"Ten Feet Tall\" came out of the flush of his relationship with his first serious love, and helped land him a deal with Island records.\n\nHe released his own recording of the song, and sang on Afrojack's version. An EP followed, but after a long period of creative searching Wrabel hadn't found what he was looking for, and he and the label parted ways. He found himself back in Los Angeles, wondering if it was time to pursue a career as a songwriter rather than an artist.",

  "artistSummary": "CAMERON AVERY\nDrink in hand, his bowtie hanging, the Western Australian-born Cameron Avery has arrived as a new breed of nocturnal crooner, a train-wreck romantic creating timeless, ambitious music for the modern age. \n\n \n\nUtilizing his soulful wit, shrewd arrangements, and a deep, husky baritone, Avery harnesses the dark power and humor of artists like Nick Cave, Scott Walker, and Tindersticks to expertly walk the fine line between vulnerable and venerable.\n\n \n\nHailing from the late 2000’s-era Perth and a healthy scene of hard-hitting garage rock bands, including a long stint as the drummer of Pond, Avery found his musical footing while playing with friends but sought the reward of his own outfit. Encouraged by his friend Kevin Parker of Tame Impala to record on his own, Avery started The Growl as his solo project in 2007, making an EP and an album of aggressive, distorted psychedelic rock and roll. When Parker asked him to join Tame Impala as its touring bassist in 2013, Avery jumped at the chance and rose with that band to the top of the psych-rock heap, but all the while remained focused on carving out his singular identity as an artist and following his own muse.\n\nWhen a longer break for Tame Impala arrived, Avery decided to head to the US to continue work on his album. Melancholic machismo is written into the very DNA of Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams. From the classical, finger-picked guitar on the opener “A Time and Place” and the orchestral vamping of “Do You Know Me By Heart?” to the bombastic, self-assured swagger of “Dance with Me.” He takes an emotive page from the Leonard Cohen songbook-of-longing on “Big Town Girl” just as naturally as he thumbs an aggressive note of Bad Seed strut and Cramps rut on “Watch Me Take It Away.” And by the time he purrs that earnest refrain of “Baby, it’s you” on the album’s closer “C’est Toi,” Avery has surely mastered that drunken tightrope dance.",

  "artistSummary": "\n                      You can count the number of bands who've stayed together for 20 years on two hands, and you can use just one to count those who've consistently released quality material for two decades. This year, The Bouncing Souls enter that esteemed category, and in keeping with their D.I.Y. roots, they've done it without major labels, corporate radio, MTV, or teen magazine pinups.\n\nWhen married couples celebrate twenty years together, they're usually showered with anniversary gifts. The Bouncing Souls are celebrating their milestone by reversing that tradition and giving back to the fans, releasing one original song per month throughout 2009. More on that later, but first let's look back on some earlier days…\n\nPicture it: 1989, a Knights of Columbus Hall in Bernardsville, New Jersey. A supportive music-loving teacher throws down $120 to cover expenses. A bunch of sweaty high school kids gather to sneak beers and rock all night at the debut show of a band called The Bouncing Souls. And a Jersey institution is born.\n\nBut the Souls' story actually begins a few years earlier than that historic gig. \"Pete [Steinkopf] and Bryan [Kienlen] had a cover band called The Switch around '86 and '87,\" recalls frontman Greg Attonito. The band was largely booked at parties teeming with college chicks and kegstands, and occasionally, their friend Attonito would join in to channel his inner Roger Daltrey or Billy Idol.\n\n\"Then we started another band called Brad Karma and the Absent Minded Fruit Bats,\" says guitarist Steinkopf. \"There was one song that we had called 'Quest For Goodie' and Greg would jump around and sing all kinds of crazy shit to it off the top of his head. We were all teenagers growing up in the suburbs, just looking to create our own fun.\"\n\nThe threesome spent ever more time hanging at shows in New York City and haunting Trenton's legendary, late, great City Gardens. The chemistry was undeniable and unstoppable, and it wasn't long before their creative juices flowed together. Tapping original drummer Shal Khichi, the band holed up in Greg's dad's attic and started writing what would make up the early Souls songbook.\n\nLike any young band with energy to burn and original songs under their belt, the boys took to the road in order to share their music and spirit with any crowd that would listen. While there were aspirations to find audiences across the globe, even college parties and basements were enough to keep hope alive in the early days. As bassist Kienlen puts it, \"We never spent too much time worrying about the future. The point of the band was always celebrating the here and now, trying to make the best of whatever was in front of us at the time.\"\n\nThough it wasn't until 1995 that the band was able to tour on a full-time basis, they soon found the road to be a more frequent home than the comfort of their own beds. From headlining tiny rooms in remote towns to playing Wembley Arena with Green Day and Tokyo's Budokan with My Chemical Romance to spending time on seven different editions of Vans Warped Tour (totalling 11 months, with more sure to come), The Bouncing Souls have clocked more travel time than most airline pilots.\n\nSince 1996, the band has had a constant traveling companion and honorary fifth member - their primary touring vehicle, lovingly called The White Castle. For ten years, she gave dutiful service, until The Gold Tour, when her engine gave out - with 300,000 miles on the odometer. Regarding her decade of service before temporary retirement (the proceeds from that tour are rebuilding the old gal's guts), Attonito says, \"We converted those miles into road hours. Estimating about 40 MPH - because a lot of them aren't highway miles, with plenty of time sitting in traffic - it was staggering. Our estimate rounded out to 333.33 days driving in our truck! No exaggeration: that's about a full year!\"\n\nFortunately, there are many more tour dates in store for both the band and their beloved Castle. Exactly how many of those dates is impossible to say, though, since the band hasn't exactly been keeping score. \"I'd love to figure out how many shows we've played...I wish we kept count,\" says Steinkopf. \"I know bands that have and it's awesome. It must be way up in the thousands by now, though.\"\n\nFrequent attendees of those gigs (true believers, all) hail the Souls as one of the best bands in the world, and the boys feel the same devotion to their fans. \"Bouncing Souls fans are the greatest friends ever,\" enthuses Attonito, \"They're passionate and full of life. They really are part of the band in the sense that we're plowing a path through life together in good times and in bad.\"\n\n\"It's pretty much across the board too,\" adds Steinkopf. \"every age group...all different kinds of people. My favorite is when we meet people that were there from the start and now they have kids of their own that they bring to our shows. We really are a part of each others' lives.\"\n\n\"And any time someone says you've influenced them certainly makes an impact on you. To know that someone has looked at something you've done and they have taken something from it - whether it be in a lyric or the way you play your instrument - has got to be the highest compliment paid,\" says drummer Michael McDermott. As a final piece of evidence, Kienlen points to the MySpace gallery of band-based tattoos adorning their admirers: \"Last I checked it's up to almost 300 and counting. Our fans are hardcore in their unwavering support. We really are one big family.\"\n\nAnd families share things, which is why this year, the Souls have decided to gift their family of friends and fans with twelve spanking new songs, available for the standard less-than-a-buck download on the first of each month in '09, or for purchase on 7\" vinyl in quarterly compilations on their own Chunksaah Records (each featuring one additional bonus track).\n\nSteinkopf elaborates: \"We all decided that we wanted to do something different. We'd been on the same schedule for years: write a record, record a record, wait for the record to come out, then tour on it until we wanted to start the cycle again. We also wanted to break our own patterns and do something that was going to be inspiring and new for us.\"\n\nAttonito adds \"I remember being in New Zealand and saying we should do a release that doesn't come out all at once…I was thinking in the context of a TV series. Somebody else might have come up with the first of the month idea but usually all the creative stuff we do is a process. Everybody kind of throws a stick on the fire at the right time in the collaboration.\"\n\nDoing it for the sake of the music, the fans, and their own inspiration for twenty years, the group – and their White Castle – are going pedal to the metal on a full tank of gas. According to their frontman, \"The shared driving force is part of the mechanics that keeps the beast truckin' down the next highway. We were - and still are - a few passionate, rebellious, creative, idealistic, party loving punks looking for a good time, for something to believe in, and for something meaningful to live for.\"\n\nWith twenty years behind these legends from the Garden State, there's a lot more still to come from The B.S. – and that's no bull.\n                    ",

This rare occasion, together with heavy touring both in Finland and abroad laid the groundwork for Swallow the Sun's skyrocketing success. In September 2006 Swallow the Sun recorded “Hope”, which was released in January of 2007 and impressively hit position #3 on the Official Finnish Album Chart, a feat never before achieved anywhere in the world with a doom album. A year after Swallow the Sun recorded ambitiously “Plague of Butterflies” –EP, which was released by Spinefarm Records in Europe, “Plague of Butterflies” crashed into the Number 1 spot on the Finnish charts in its first week. The EP was released in the US on September 23rd, and was followed by an extensive Finnish and American tour in early 2009.  ",

After the talent show, the band decided to play covers together for fun. As they got older, Phinehas and Byron started writing original songs together. With the maturity, writing originals became more than just an after school hobby. As things became more serious, the line up changed with it. After a few years of gigging, the band was discovered by Richard Segovia who took them under his wing. After some more line up changes, Phinehas and Byron decided to turn the band into a duo. Currently the two are releasing their debut EP on October 23rd.

The band consists of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments), Colin Greenwood (bass), Phil Selway (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals). They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of the band's debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's style, as they incorporated influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Despite initially dividing fans and critics, Kid A was later named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was the band's final album for their record label, EMI; their subsequent releases have been self-released. Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. Their ninth album is expected in 2016. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.\n                    ",

They have worked with producer Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead released their debut single \"Creep\" in 1992. It became a worldwide hit after the release of the band's debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their popularity and critical standing rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame; with an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, it is often acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time. Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a dramatic evolution in Radiohead's style, as they incorporated influences from experimental electronic music, 20th-century classical music, krautrock, and jazz. Despite initially dividing fans and critics, Kid A was later named the best album of the decade by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of rock and electronic music with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was the band's final album for their record label, EMI; their subsequent releases have been self-released. Radiohead released their seventh album, In Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), was an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. Their ninth album is expected in 2016. Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their work places highly in both listener polls and critics' lists of the best music of the 1990s and 2000s. In 2005, they were ranked 73rd in Rolling Stone's list of \"The Greatest Artists of All Time\"; Jonny Greenwood (48th) and O'Brien were both included in Rolling Stone's list of greatest guitarists, and Yorke (66th) in their list of greatest singers. In 2009, Rolling Stone readers voted the group the second best artist of the 2000s.\n                    ",

The tour announces on the heels of Legend’s fifth studio album Darkness and Light, which has received a plethora of critical praise since its December 2nd release on Columbia Records. USA Today hailed the album as John’s “most personal record” with tracks like “Right By You” which they described as “a heart –tugging rumination on his 7-month old daughter, Luna.” Time Magazine called the body of work “unflappably classy” while the New York Times said Legend “treats love as something far more complex than a panacea and a fount of perpetual reassurance, with music to match.” Continuing, the New York Times pointed to the album’s most recent anthemic hit single, “Love Me Now”, which they praised as “a seize the moment song”, that “revolves around an insistent, lo-fi piano figure, and its chorus first arrives with Mr. Legend nearly alone, singing over simple, fading chords”.\nLegend also continues his successful foray into the world of film as one of the principles for production company Get Lifted Film Co., which has an executive producing credit on the 14-time Oscar-nominated film La La Land in which John also appears, playing a jazz band leader named Keith alongside stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.

Nothing could have made 3EB happier! 3EB, however, have experienced no comparable loss. Instead, they have gained artistic clarification — and, surprisingly, a fan base who is larger, younger and more dedicated than ever. Participation in the older, untouchable realm of nervous star-making could color a band’s identity. In the case of 3EB, it often blurred the perception of their brilliant musical creations. In recent years, those creations have recast the band among a current generation of fans. 3EB now write, tour, record, and communicate in a fluid new world where their music continues naturally to evolve. Their exchange with their audience is unfiltered and being from the hub of tech, they are using it to develop a closer exchange with their audience. After a stunning festival run in 2016 with appearances at Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Bumbershoot, Bonnaroo and many others, they are poised for a fantastic 20th Anniversary celebration in 2017 with new material to be released.\n                    ",

  "artistSummary": "\n                      It was last spring 2012, and John Gourley—frontman of Portugal. The Man—found himself in New York City about to ring the bell at Danger Mouse’s apartment–a long way from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza—up until this moment, Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range.\nWhen it came time to begin work on the seventh album, Gourley thought long and hard about the next move and kept coming back to one concept: The most satisfying work is collaborative work. From building houses with his father in Alaska to building a devoted fanbase, he had sought partnerships. So he took a bold step — bold for a proven band, bolder still for its uncertainty of sound — a step up to the apartment of a possible collaborator, Danger Mouse.\nSo Danger Mouse — aka Brian Burton, the five-time Grammy award winning producer behind everything from Gnarls Barkley and Beck to The Black Keys and now U2 —and the band agreed that they were game for the challenge and began production on what would become Evil Friends, the undaunted re-awakening for Portugal. The Man. As much as their collaborative imaginations melded, to construct songs that lived up to the ambitious visions they had would take some time. After all, here was a band with an evolving lineup — Kyle O’Quin on keyboards, Noah Gersh on guitar/percussion/keyboards, and Kane Ritchotte on drums joined Zach Carothers on bass and vocals and Gourley on lead vocals and guitar — building new songs with a new producer trying to do something neither of them had done before.\nIn 2010, Local Natives galvanized a musical scene in Southern California, crafting a sound that they loved, and that others flocked to in turn, with the breakout success of their debut album, Gorilla Manor. The five-piece from Los Angeles featuring Taylor Rice, Kelcey Ayer, Ryan Hahn, Nik Ewing, and Matt Frazier have since created a series of different cathartic chapters informed by their constantly changing surroundings.\nAs the band began to grow, so too grew its lens, and suddenly the “indie rock” lens cap did not seem to fit any longer. These 30-year-old Los Angelenos had seen the world and heard its sounds, and knew, deep down, that there was more in them. And, as in the style and paths of those arcs of our heroes, when Local Natives filtered this whole new layer of influences through their spectrum, the result is an everywhere-you-turn showcase of vision and virtuosity and their grandest statement yet: their third album, Sunlit Youth.\nWhat has always been there for Local Natives is their meticulous crafting of musical elements while constantly pushing and pulling melody, harmony, and rhythmic components from within their construct and out into the cosmos. Their method lends to a dynamic beyond cerebral execution and into pure, unbridled emotional and energetic territory. As the hedges grow higher in our minds, the band has tapped into that which got the seeds planted in the first place, and the result is an empowering concept of eternal life embodying what Sunlit Youth is all about.\nLooking back upon their own youths yet constantly moving forward to the future, Local Natives have embraced their evolution and made what could be seen as the most Local Natives-sounding album of their young careers.\n                    ",

It’s at times haunting and warm, and a bit more refined and sophisticated, but still plenty playful, retaining the guts and soul of classic Mac.\n",

  "artistSummary": "Don Carlos\nDon Carlos (born Euvin Spencer) Legendary Reggae Artist was born and raised in one of the most deprived regions of Western Kingston, Jamaica, in a district notoriously known as Waterhouse, which incidentally is also a musical spawning ground for many of Reggae's greatest ever talents, such as King Tubby, Black Uhuru, The Jays, Junior Reid and King Jammy, to name but a few. Don Carlos started his singing career in 1973 as one of the original members of Black Uhuru, alongside other founding members, Garth Dennis who later went on to joining the Wailing Souls, and Derrick Ducky Simpson. As part of the trio, Don sang lead on the highly acclaimed Love Crisis album, for producer Prince Jammy in 1977. This album was later re-released and re-titled as Black Sounds of Freedom. A year after the trio's groundbreaking debut, Don Carlos surprisingly decided to leave Black Uhuru in pursuit of a solo career. Within three years as a solo artist, developing his song writing and grooming his distinctive vocal style, in May 1981 Suffering was released. This strong release took the fraternity by storm, courtesy of a heavy roots and culture flavored showcase for the Negus Roots label. This album was a massive hit in Africa, selling unprecedented units. Unfortunately, the album was bootlegged, and Don never received proper royalties.\n\nAt this time, he worked alongside Goldie, his sidekick, co writer, and back up vocalist. Together they built a staunch following through touring the live circuit and releasing consistant albums including Harvest Time, Day to Day Living, Them Never Know A Natty Dread Have Credentials, all three issued in 1982, Spread Out 1982 also otherwise known as Laser Beam to which the majority of tracks in this set have been culled, Never Run Away 1984, Just a Passing Glance 1985 and more recently Seven Days a Week. Don's partner, Gold was tragically shot and crippled, putting him out of the music business.\n\nDuring the eighties dance hall mania, Don had five top ten hits between 1982 – 1985- Late Night Blues, Nice Time Tonight, Dice Cup, Hog & Goat, I'm Not Getting Crazy and Spread Out. Don is still churning out solid, melodic roots reggae. Other titles in his rich catalogue include Roots and Culture, Raving Tonight, Pure Gold, Spread Out, Plantation, Never Run Away, Slow Down Vol. 3, Rasta Brothers, Prophecy, Firehouse Clash, Deeply Concerned, Ease Up, Lazer Beam, Ras Portraits, Grove w/me, Head to Head, Jah Light, Live in San Francisco (2002), and Special Edition. There's an old saying in the music industry that claims: What goes around, comes back around. In Dons' case, a request for reinstatement to his former role as lead vocalist for a rejuvenated Black Uhuru reunion resulted in another strong Black Uhuru album – Now. 1990 marked the reunion of the original vocal trio with Don, Garth and Duckie. After six years- 1989-1994- and four albums, singing lead for Black Uhuru in the studio, and on the road, Don again went back to his solo career. His other titles with Black Uhuru include Mystical Truths, Iron Storm and Strong. All of these four albums are classics with Don up front on lead vocals.\n\nAfter the Black Uhuru stretch, Don joined forces with the California based Reggae Angels, who backed him for four years. He then kept some of the core Reggae Angels musicians for his own permanent backing band. He has been touring successfully with this band in Europe, South America, Hawaii, and the western US. Don's popularity has been consistently growing, so he is now one of the most sought after roots reggae artists in the business.

  "artistSummary": "Buck Johnson\nSinger/songwriter Buck Johnson hails from the back roads of Shady Grove, Alabama, just outside Birmingham where he grew up singing Gospel throughout the South with his musical family. Since then he has performed in churches, bars, festivals and concert halls throughout the world. He currently is the keyboardist and backing vocalist for legendary rock band Aerosmith and has also toured and recorded with such notable artists as The Doobie Brothers, Tal Bachman, John Waite, Shawn Mullins, Matthew Sweet, Timothy B. Schmit of the Eagles and many more. \n\nAs a songwriter, Buck has been influenced by the music he grew up with…namely Southern-Rock, Gospel, Blues and English bands that were influenced by music of the South such as The Rolling Stones, Led Zepplin, The Beatles, and many others. Buck co-wrote the international hit single for Carlos Santana “Just Feel Better” featuring Steven Tyler from Aerosmith in 2005. He was a member of the Country band Whiskey Falls which had 2 Top 40 Country singles released from their self-titled 2007 album...\"Last Train Running\" and \"Falling Into You\". Buck also has had numerous songs in T.V. shows and in major film releases.\n\nBuck is excited to announce the release of his debut album in mid 2015 on Spectra Records which will showcase songs that reflect his life journey with all it’s ups and downs. Songs like “Enjoying The Ride” and “Live For The Song” describe the musical road of a “lifer” singer-songwriter/musician with all the twists and turns. “Country, Rockin’ and Reelin” talks about his musical roots, influences, where he’s from and the musical place he lives today. “Southern Belle”, a fun, CCR influenced romp, is about the attraction to a beautiful, and fiery Southern woman. And “After All These Years” is an emotional ballad about the love shared with and commitment he has to his beautiful wife Kym. \n\nThe album consists of the world class musicians Buck has been recording and playing with in Nashville, Tn. There are also guest appearances from notable musicians like Kenny Aronoff on drums, Waddy Wachtel on guitar and Stuart Duncan on fiddle. \n\nAll the songs were written by the writing team of Buck Johnson and producer/songwriter Charlie Midnight (James Brown, Joe Cocker, The Doobie Brothers, Joni Mitchell, Jamie Johnson, Hillary Duff), with collaborations on “Enjoying The Ride” and “Live For The Song” with hit Nashville songwriter James Hicks. The album is produced by producer/mixer Mark Needham (Chris Isaak, Fleetwood Mac, The Killers), Charlie Midnight and Buck Johnson.",

  "artistSummary": "Stymie & the Pimp Jones Luv Orchestra\nIt ain't easy being stankalicious. This is especially true if you are an independent entity. But the funk is proving to be more relevant in the 21st century than ever before. Case in point: the recent revival and revitalization of Stymie and the Pimp Jones Love Orchestra, a San Francisco-based, multi-piece outfit lead by singer/songwriter Sean \"Stymie\" Sharp.\n\nStymie is an animated individual. When he speaks about anything, from music to comics to movies, he speaks with an intense and jovial vigor that is as learned as it is inspired. His tiny apartment is littered with ol' school accoutrements, from VHS tapes to boomboxes, but the beauty of modern media trends does not elude him whatsoever. \"With file sharing and Youtube,\" says Stymie, \"you are in more control of what you listen to.\" Thus, you can seek out what you like instead of being nudged into it or spoon-fed something more formulaic.\n\nOn this point, Stymie argues, \"It is true that not all things are for all people. But this does not mean that you shouldn't give people – the fans – the benefit of the doubt.\" The man is speaking about categories and genres, abstract concoctions that lead people to \"wearing uniforms. Like I got my punk rocker uniform and he's got his gangster uniform and so on.\" And sure, if you're gonna call Stymie and the PJLO anything, the man doesn't completely object to being tagged as a leader of a funk band, as he explains: \"Funk is the least limited genre. 'Funk gets stronger' – to quote George Clinton – but we don't want to limit things at all.\" In other words, Stymie does not want to \"categorize the fan base,\" as he is also inclined to dip his creative pen into avenues such as ska, R&B, rock, reggae, and even go-go. This musical diversity was a bit harder to realize way back in the 20th century, when massive corporations still dictated listening trends and indies had less resources for getting heard. But now? The game is on.\n\nThe band has come a long way and has accomplished a lot of things to get to the pinnacle thatit is at today. The current incarnation, a combo of veteran soldiers and funky-fresh blood, has Stymie tickled stink. \"This version of the band is carving out its own identity with these newsongs.\" Indeed, he has been writing new ditties at an astonishing rate, \"inspired by the blessing of these talented people.\" The current, exuberant and extra-tight line-up includes drummer Jon Merker, Brian Hill on guitar, bassist Martin Ledyard, Jerry Goldstone on guitar, Brigham Hausman on trombone, Keith Waldorf on trumpet, Emery Dora on keyboard, Tupac Mauricio Saavedra on saxophone, as well as vocalists Jospeh \"Mojo\" Powell, Erica Chriss Patten, Marilee Bazzano.\n\nThe new material, with such titles as \"Brand New Mustard Machine,\" \"La Toure A Go-Go,\"and \"Love in Space,\" will debut in late 2010 – (though a song or two might leak out on the web before that!) And in an effort to whet the appetites of longtime and potential fans alike,the band has uploaded high-quality performance footage of classic Stymie and the PJLO material on Youtube, tunes that can be heard on previous releases such as Dem Sum Goodies and The Secret Hits of the Black and Blue Parade.\n\nStymie, who grew up in Hollywood off of Sunset, started the band in San Francisco in 1996. The first lineup featured Joe \"Mojo\" Powell, a soulful harmonizer who still sings with the band today, and Marilee Bazzano soon followed. As for the band name, Stymie thought it up while walking down Haight Street, and the name, like his songs, are meant to remind the audience that there ain't nothin' but overflowin' imagination around here. The band soon proved itself to be incredible live, and while it has enjoyed the honor of opening gigs for the likes of Earth, Wind, & Fire, Fred Wesley, and Billy Preston over the years, Stymie and thePJLO has been packing 'em in with its own sold-out headlining shows for over a decade now.\n\nThis is why it is imperative for YOU to come see the man and his crew in a theatre near you.",

  "artistSummary": "Kacey Chambers\nThere’s a moment in most artists’ young lives when they realise music will shape their future and define who they are. Kasey Chambers didn’t have to wait for that moment to arrive. Music is part of her DNA.\n\nBorn in Mt Gambier in South Australia, Kasey grew up in a home environment where listening to and performing country and roots music was a way of life. It had to rub off _and it did _ just as in later years, living on the Nullarbor Plain and travelling all over Australia with her family, the young Kasey got an education like no other.\n\nShe spent her childhood absorbing the music of Hank Williams, Emmylou Harris, Johnny Cash and other country greats loved by her parents. It was in the family’s revered Dead Ringer Band with dad Bill, mum Di and older brother Nash that 10-year-old Kasey got her first real taste of being on stage. By the time she was in her late teens she was fronting the band and writing some of the songs.\n\nA change came in 1998 when Kasey, at the age of 22, travelled overseas on a rites-of-passage voyage of discovery. She came back ready to start her solo career. The resultant album, The Captain (1999) remains one of the most extraordinary and lauded debuts by an Australian artist in any genre. Songs such as the title track, ‘Cry Like a Baby’ and ‘These Pines’ boast a maturity beyond her years and a wealth of Americana-styled musical influences, yet the album has Australia and family at its core, ingredients that have been a staple of Kasey’s song-writing ever since then.",

  "artistSummary": "Wake The Dead\nAs an expression of cultural joy, you can’t top an Irish wake. And what is a wake but a celebration-a toast of appreciation-an expression of love-and a damn good party?\n\nSo when seven top Bay Area musicians realized they shared as deep a love for the songs of the Grateful Dead as they did for traditional Celtic tunes, some brand-new music sprang up and started partying.\n\nWAKE THE DEAD is a romp that flows seamlessly from rock grooves to hot Irish reels, and from haunting airs to achingly beautiful melodies familiar to Deadheads everywhere. “Sugaree” in waltz time, bracketed by an ancient harp tune and infused with a poignant Celtic longing. “Bertha” thundering out of “China Cat” on a mandolin tidal wave. The eerie lilt of the uilleann pipes, giving a glow to “Bird Song” as if it was always meant to be there. Groove jams to keep the tie-dye swirling. Vocal harmonies that float like clouds. The music takes off, and the band follows, grinning all the way. These aren’t worlds colliding-they’re worlds meshing, coalescing­ creating a whole new world of possibility, and true to the spirits of the Grateful Dead and the eternally hopeful Celts.\n\nWAKE THE DEAD bands together seven of the best-known and most respected players in the west. Harper Maureen Brennan has toured for over 30 years and recorded the acclaimed “Harpistry” collection. Bassist Cindy Browne is equally at home in folk and jazz, touring globally as the musical fusion go-to gal. Singer, fiddler, and octave mandolinist Danny Carnahan is an award-winning songwriter whose original Irish-tinged songs are popular worldwide. Kevin Carr is a musical triple-threat, renowned as a dance fiddler, a pennywhistler, and Irish piper par excellence. Sylvia Herold’s delicious vocal phrasing can also be heard on her solo recordings and her performances with Euphonia. Paul Kotapish is known far and wide for his work with Kevin Burke’s Open House, and for his blazing guitar and mandolin with The Hillbillies From Mars and Euphonia. And Latin percussionist Brian Rice rounds out the band’s groove engine.",

  "artistSummary": "Adrian Belew\nAdrian Belew is a legendary guitarist well-known for his diverse travels around the musical map. He is a multi-instrumentalist whose solo records are critically acclaimed. His moving singing voice and prolific songwriting has endeared a loyal fan base of music lovers. His music is being discovered everyday by more and more listeners thirsty for great music with a creative standard not often pushed by the commercial music industry.\n\nAdrian first appeared on the guitar-world radar when he toured with Frank Zappa who later said, \"Adrian reinvented electric guitar\". Adrian's signature tones, unique use of effects and whammy bar remains completely different, and his techniques continue to be a huge influence on today's guitarists. He was guitarist, songwriter and frontman Progressive Rock Powerhouse King Crimson for over 30 years. \"Discipline\", Adrian's first record with King Crimson, is listed among the most important rock records ever made.\n\nBelew has had a career that commands both awe and respect from fellow musicians and loyal fans, from his first solo record \"The Lone Rhino\" to The Atlantic Records hit album \"Mr. Music Head\" or any of his other 20 solo records that push sonic boundaries while maintaining artistic integrity. Adrian shreds on guitar but also writes beautiful songs that will make you cry. Yes, Adrian has taken his fans on a wild ride through countless world tours and albums with David Bowie, Talking Heads, Laurie Anderson, NIN and Paul Simon. He truly is the Twang Bar King!\n\nMeanwhile, Belew continues work on the latest additions to his FLUX project, including an album called FLUXbybelew and an in-app addition entitled FLUXation. FLUX is 'music which is never the same twice'. To accommodate the original concept FLUX was released on iTunes as a music app for iPhone and iPad (the only one of its kind, available on iTunes at bit.ly/FLUX_cd) with the app downloaded, you press Play to activate 30 minutes of music, songs, sounds, and visuals which will never happen again in quite the same way. that's because of some very clever algorithms and a huge amount of content.",

  "artistSummary": "Jackie Greene\n\"We live in such a fast-paced, hectic environment, I wanted to make a record that would invite people to step back and take their time to listen,\" Jackie Greene says of Back to Birth, his first album in five years. \"I wanted to make a record that would reward people who are willing to sit down and give it a couple of serious listens.\"\n\nBack to Birth - Greene's seventh album and his Yep Roc Records debut - is more than worthy of some serious attention. The 11-song set showcases the multitalented artist's uncanny knack for synthesizing his deep affinity for American roots styles into timeless, personally-charged music. Armed with a persuasive voice, a vivid songwriting skill and an instinctive mastery of several instruments, Greene has carved out a unique musical niche, and the album marks another creative landmark in his already compelling body of work.\n\nProduced by Los Lobos member and frequent Greene collaborator Steve Berlin, Back to Birth underlines Greene's remarkable evolution as a performer and writer. With such new compositions as \"Silver Lining,\" \"Trust Somebody,\" \"Now I Can See For Miles,\" and the stirring title track, the artist's distinctive melodic sensibility is matched with thoughtful, introspective lyrics that confront some profound philosophical issues with plainspoken eloquence.\n\n\"Musically, this album is kind of a return to the simplicity of the records that I started with, although I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm doing now,\" Greene observes. \"I think the lyrics are the part that have really evolved. A lot of these songs explore the notion of a cyclical existence, and the sense that life goes in a circle. I want the songs to come from a place that's meaningful to me, but I also want to keep them as simple and direct as I can. I look at old blues songs, or Hank Williams songs, and they're so simple and direct but they can convey some pretty deep ideas.\"\n\nAlthough Back to Birth is Greene's first new solo release in five years, he's hardly been idle. In fact, he's spent much of the past few years engaging in a series of collaborative musical adventures that have teamed him with several notable veterans.\n\nIn 2013, Greene joined the reunited Black Crowes as lead guitarist on their worldwide tour, and the following year released the self-titled debut album of supergroup Trigger Hippy, which Greene is a member of along with Joan Osborne and Crowes drummer Steve Gorman. Greene continues to be a frequent member of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s touring ensemble Phil Lesh & Friends, for which he has contributed lead guitar and vocals since 2007. Greene also toured as part of WRG, an acoustic trio with the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson, and he performed with Levon Helm as part of Helm's fabled Midnight Ramble shows.\n\nThe same qualities that attracted such legendary figures to work with Greene are prominent throughout Back to Birth, which Greene and producer Berlin cut at Portland's Supernatural Sound with a sympathetic crew of mostly jazz-steeped players, with Greene stretching out on a number of instruments, including guitar, piano, organ and drums.\n\n\"This is the third album I've done with Steve,\" he says. \"I've known him for about 12 years, and he's really good at challenging me and getting it out of me. We know each other well enough at this point that we can be blunt with each other, and he'll tell me that I'm full of it if that's what I need to hear.\"\n\nThe musical passion and creative integrity that drive Back to Birth have been constants in Jackie Greene's musical life from the start. While growing up in Northern California, he taught himself to play piano and guitar. His musical reference points shifted radically when, at the age of 14, he ran across a cache of his parents' vintage rock, country, blues and R&B LPs in the family's basement.\n\nStill in his teens and inspired by his discoveries, Greene began writing songs and performing them at a local coffeehouse while recording his compositions in his makeshift garage studio and burning CDRs to sell at his gigs. He saved the money he made selling those discs to fund his debut album, the self-produced, self-released Rusty Nails. Despite being a D.I.Y. release with minimal promotion, the disc received substantial regional attention from fans and press alike.\n\nHis popularity led to a deal with a local independent label, which released his second album, Gone Wanderin', in late 2002. The disc won considerable national attention, leading to a series of national tours opening for the likes of B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Susan Tedeschi, Huey Lewis, Mark Knopfler and Taj Mahal.\n\nGreene continued to win critical acclaim and expand his fan base with 2004's Sweet Somewhere Bound and 2006's American Myth. In 2007, Greene began moonlighting with Phil Lesh and Friends, while continuing his own musical evolution with his own releases Giving Up the Ghost and Till the Light Comes, released in 2008 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\"The musicians that I really admire and try to emulate are the ones who have the whole package: they're great songwriters, great singers and great instrumentalists, and they have a vibe about them that's real,\" he states, adding, \"When I go to make a record, I'm not thinking about where I can fit in a bunch of guitar solos. I'm thinking, 'What does this song feel like? What's it saying?' So my goal, when writing a song or making a record, is to find the core of that emotional experience and convey that.\"\n\nAlthough he's already racked up a multitude of impressive musical achievements, Greene isn't one to look back. Instead, he continues to look to the future - and looks forward to getting back on the road to bring Back to Birth's soulful songcraft to the loyal, wildly diverse fan base that he's built through talent, vision and hard work.\n\n\"I still plan on making a lot of different kinds of records in the future, but I can't tell you what they're going to sound like, because I really have no idea,\" he asserts. \"All I can do is write songs and make music as honestly as I can. That's what I believe people appreciate about what I do. They trust me to be honest with them, and I'd never want to abuse that trust.\"",

Now an accomplished artist in his own right, Luning is preparing to release his most dynamic and gripping collection to date, 'Restless,' and he can trace it all back to one fateful night that changed everything.\n\n\"A couple of friends invited me over to share some songs at their apartment, and that was the first time I'd ever really listened to Americana music or folk or country or whatever you want to call it,\" remembers Luning. \"They showed me John Prine, and it just resonated with me so much. I was like, 'Oh my god, this is what I have to do with my life.' I just figured it out in that moment.\"\n\nLuning dropped out of school almost immediately, moved back to his native California, and devoted himself to songwriting and performing. He worked his way up through open mics to large festival performances, piecing together a band to flesh out his songs along the way and hitting the road to tour with a fierce determination. His self-released debut album, 'Just Drop On By,' garnered acclaim from both critics and fellow musicians alike, with country megastar Keith Urban hailing Luning's \"staunch originality.\" Songs from the album landed numerous film and TV placements, most recently on NBC's 'Grimm,' and Luning's reputation for exhilarating live performances earned him dates with luminaries like Jackie Greene, Dave and Phil Alvin, and Elvin Bishop, along with a slew of festival performances up and down the West Coast. \n\nIf 'Just Drop On by' announced the arrival of a promising new talent, 'Restless' delivers on that potential and then some. Recorded under the guidance of engineer/producer Karl Derfler (Tom Waits, Dave Matthews) and with Luning's longtime live bandmates—Ben Dubin (bass & harmonica), Linden Reed (drums), and Dave Sampson (guitar & mandolin)—the album marks a major step forward, both sonically and emotionally.\n\n\"With the first record, I produced and engineered everything myself,\" explains Luning. \"I'd never worked with an outside producer before, so it was nerve-racking going into the studio with Karl for the first time, but it was just a perfect fit. It was like he knew what I wanted in my music before I even did, and he could push my performances where they needed to go and really take my music to another level.\"\n\nLuning and his band set up shop at the stunning Panoramic Studios in Stinson, California, crafting a darker, grittier vibe for the music and exploring a wider palette than ever before. While many of Luning's songs are inspired by the lives and stories of the men and women he's grown up with in California or met on the road, the lyrics are all filtered through his own unique perspective and reflect his remarkable personal journey. Perhaps no track fits that bill more directly than \"Driftin,'\" an infectious road warrior's anthem that find's Luning singing, \"I wanna keep on drifting like a rambling man.\" \n\n\"I had so much fun on tour going from place to place and playing to new people all the time and I got into the rhythm of it all, so when it ended and we came home I wasn't ready to stop,\" he explains. \"We pulled into Ben's house to unload our gear and I said, 'Ben, we're packing up and we're gonna go somewhere tomorrow right? We're gonna keep on going right?'\" \n\nMuch of the album is uptempo and exuberant—\"Almost Sounds Like Laughing\" is a foot-stomping folk tune with the energy of a runaway train—but Luning shows off his remarkable depth and range on some of the record's more restrained tracks, like the slow-burning \"Brother In Chains\" and delicate \"Gonna Forget About You,\" which finds him pulling his vocals back to an intimate near-whisper that conveys a world of heartache and regret. \"In Hell I Am\" started life as an acoustic blues on a resonator guitar before morphing into a fiery, electric rocker, while \"Bet It All On Black\" takes on a harder, Southern edge, with Luning repeating the mantra, \"Ain't no use in holding back.\" \n\n\"It's essentially about a person who's kind of carefree,\" he says, \"and they know that something might not be the best thing to do, but they're going all in with it anyway. They're just going for it, regardless of the outcome and any repercussions they might face.\" \n\nIf that sounds familiar, perhaps like the attitude of a man who might risk everything to drop out of school and move across the country to pursue a dream, it's no coincidence. With songs this good, it's a safe bet that a restless soul like David Luning is going to keep on traveling for a long time to come.",
